    "content": "Greek coastguards charged over 2023 migrant shipwreck\n10 hours ago\nShare\nSave\nNick Beake\nEurope correspondent\nKostas Kallergis\nSenior Europe producer\nShare\nSave\nA naval court in Greece has charged 17 coastguards over the deadliest migrant boat disaster in the Mediterranean Sea for a decade.\nUp to 650 people were feared to have drowned when the overcrowded Adriana fishing vessel sank near Pylos, off the Greek coast, in the early hours of 14 June 2023.\nSurvivors later told the BBC that Greek coastguards had caused their boat to capsize in a botched attempt to tow it and then silenced witnesses.\n\"It has taken us two years just for these charges to come, even though so many people witnessed what happened,\" one of the survivors said on Monday.\nThe Greek authorities have always denied the claims against them.\nCaptain of coastguard ship charged\nThe Deputy Prosecutor of the Piraeus Naval Court has found that 17 members of the Hellenic Coast Guard should face criminal charges.\nAmong them is the captain of the coastguard ship, the LS-920, who is charged with \"causing a shipwreck\", leading to the deaths of \"at least 82 people\".\nThis corresponds to the number of bodies recovered, although it is thought as many as an additional 500 people drowned, including women and children who were all below deck.\nThe disaster occurred in international waters but within Greece's rescue zone.\nThe then-Chief of the Coast Guard and the Supervisor of the National Search and Rescue Coordination Centre in Piraeus are among four officials charged with \"exposing others to danger\".\nThe captain of the LS-920 is also charged with \"dangerous interference of maritime transport\" as well as a \"failure to provide assistance\" to the migrant boat.\nThe crew of the ship are charged for \"simple complicity\" in all the acts allegedly committed by the captain.\nDoubts over Greek officials' account\nA coastguard ship had been monitoring the Adriana for 15 hours before it sank.\nIt had left Libya for Italy with an estimated 750 people on board. Only 104 of them are known to have survived.\nWe have been investigating since the day of the disaster and our series of findings has cast serious doubt on the official Greek version of events.\nWithin a week, we\nobtained shipping data\nwhich challenged the claim the migrant boat had not been in trouble and so did not need to be rescued.\nA month later, survivors told us\nthe coastguard had caused their boat to sink in a disastrous effort\nto tow it and then forced witnesses to stay silent.\nLast year,\na case against nine Egyptians was thrown out\n, amid claims they had been scapegoated by the Greek authorities.\nEarlier this year,\naudio recordings emerged\nwhich further challenged the official Greek version of events.\nSyrian survivors feel 'vindicated'\nWe first met Syrian refugees, who we called Ahmad and Musaab to protect their identities, a month after the disaster.\nThey said they each paid $4,500 (£3,480) for a spot on the boat.\nThe younger brother of Ahmad - a Syrian now living in Germany - was also on board and did not survive.\nMusaab described to us the moment when - he alleged - the Greek coastguards caused their boat to sink.\n\"They attached a rope from the left,\" he said. \"Everyone moved to the right side of our boat to balance it. The Greek vessel moved off quickly causing our boat to flip. They kept dragging it for quite a distance.\"\nThe men claimed that once on land, in the port of Kalamata, the coastguard told survivors to \"shut up\" when they started to talk about how the Greek authorities had caused the disaster.\n\"When people replied by saying the Greek coastguard was the cause, the official in charge of the questioning asked the interpreter to tell the interviewee to stop talking,\" Ahmad said.\nHe said officials shouted: \"You have survived death. Stop talking about the incident Don't ask more questions about it.\"\nOn Monday, Ahmad said he felt vindicated by the charges that had been brought.\n\"I'm very happy they are eventually being held accountable for all that they have committed, but until I see them in prison nothing has been done yet,\" he said.\n\"To be honest, the Greek legal system is very unreliable.\"\nLegal team for victims welcome charges\nThe joint legal team representing survivors and victims of the disaster said the decision to pursue a case against the 17 coastguards was a big step forward towards justice being done.\nIn a statement it said: \"Almost two years after the Pylos shipwreck, the prosecution and referral to main investigation for felonies of 17 members of the Coast Guard, including senior officers of its leadership, constitutes a substantial and self-evident development in the course of vindication of the victims and the delivery of justice.\"\nIt is understood the 17 men who have now been charged will be questioned in the coming weeks by the Deputy Prosecutor of the Piraeus Naval Court.\nThe court will then decide whether to send them to full trial or dismiss the charges.\nIt is not immediately clear wh...",

    "content": "India's ex-wrestling chief cleared in minor's sexual harassment case\n19 minutes ago\nShare\nSave\nMeryl Sebastian\nBBC News, Kochi\nShare\nSave\nThe former head of India's wrestling federation has been cleared in a sexual harassment case filed by a minor female wrestler.\nA court in the capital, Delhi, accepted a Delhi police report, recommending the cancellation of the case against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.\nA former MP from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Singh still faces charges of sexual harassment and stalking in a separate case by six adult female wrestlers.\nSingh has always denied these charges.\nThe cases against Singh made headlines in 2023 when he was charged with sexual harassment after months of protests by India's top wrestlers.\nThe protests made headlines globally, especially after the police detained them as they tried to march to India's new parliament building in Delhi.\nFootage of the Olympic medallists Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia and two-time world champion medallist Vinesh Phogat being dragged in the streets and carried off in police vans went viral, sparking criticism from top athletes and opposition politicians.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) also condemned the way the wrestlers were being treated and called for an impartial inquiry into their complaints.\nThe government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was criticised for not acting strongly or swiftly enough against Singh since he was a member of his party. The government had rejected the allegations.\nThe man at the centre of India's wrestling row\nIndia's wrestling chief charged with sexual harassment\nThe wrestlers agreed to pause their protests after meeting Home Minister Amit Shah and then Sports Minister Anurag Thakur.\nThakur assured them that charges would be filed against Singh by 15 June 2023.\nSeven female wrestlers, including the minor, registered complaints with the police accusing Singh of molesting and groping them at training camps and tournaments.\nIn the case of the minor, police had invoked the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.\nSingh, denied all the allegations, accusing the wrestlers of being \"politically motivated\".\nWeeks later, the minor retracted her earlier statements and withdrew her allegations,\nreports\nsaid. Wrestler Sakshi Malik told the BBC at the time that she believed \"the player was pressurised into withdrawing the charges\". Mr Singh refused to comment on the allegation, saying \"let law take its course\".\nOn Monday, legal news site Bar and Bench\nreported\nthat the police had given a report in court seeking cancellation of the case as the minor wrestler's father said he had made\na false complaint\n.\nThe prosecution lawyer said \"no corroborative evidence\" had been found in the allegations after a detailed investigation in the case.\nBar and Bench said the wrestler and her father had appeared before the court and expressed satisfaction with the police investigation. They also did not oppose the cancellation report.\nIn the aftermath of the row, Singh had stepped down as the wrestling federation chief. He was replaced by his close aide Sanjay Singh, who was later elected as the organisation's chief, leading to the accusation that Brij Bhushan Singh was still running it by proxy. The two Singhs denied the accusation but the federal sports ministry suspended the federation in December 2023.\nIn 2024, the federation resumed its functions after United World Wrestling, the international, organisation governing wrestling, lifted its ban on the Indian federation. Earlier this year, The Hindu and Indian Express newspapers reported that the Wrestling Federation of India was\nfunctioning\nout of Singh's address in Delhi.\nSingh was also denied a ticket by the BJP to contest the 2024 general election. The party instead fielded his son Karan Bhushan Singh from Kaiserganj - the seat in the northern Uttar Pradesh state which the senior Singh had held since 1999. The junior Singh won the election.\nSexual harassment\nIndia",

    "content": "What you need to know ahead of South Korea's snap presidential election\n11 hours ago\nShare\nSave\nJoel Guinto\nBBC News\nShare\nSave\nSouth Korea will elect a new president on 3 June to replace Yoon Suk Yeol, who was removed from office for placing the country under martial law for six hours in December.\nThe winner will be tasked with managing the political and economic fallout of Yoon's move, which plunged the country in deep turmoil and divided opinions.\nThe snap election is also being held as South Korea faces an unpredictable ally in US President Donald Trump - and that will shape long-running challenges such as the threat from North Korea, and Seoul's frosty relationship with China.\nHere is what you need to know as the nation of about 52 million people chooses a new president who will lead it for the next five years.\nWhy is South Korea holding a presidential election?\nYoon was supposed to serve as president until 2027, but his term ended in disgrace.\nHe shocked the nation by declaring martial law on 3 December, citing threats from \"anti-state forces\" and North Korea - but it soon became clear that he was spurred by his own political troubles.\nA week later, he was impeached by parliament. On 4 April, a constitutional court upheld his impeachment and removed him from office permanently, setting the stage for a snap presidential election within 60 days, as required by law.\nIn the six turbulent months since Yoon's martial law attempt, the country has had three acting presidents, the most recent being Lee Ju-ho, the labour minister who assumed the role one month before the election.\nLee replaced Prime Minister Han Duck Soo, who himself was impeached just weeks after taking over from Yoon as acting president. Finance minister Choi Sang-mok was acting president before Han was reinstated in March.\nWhat are the big issues in South Korea's election?\nYoon's martial law laid bare the deep political divisions in the country, as those who supported his decision to impose martial law and those who opposed it took to the streets in protest.\nThe following months of uncertainty shook public confidence in South Korea's economy. And this was at a time when US President Donald Trump unleashed his tariffs on America's trading partners, with South Korean goods facing a 25% levy.\nCloser to home, relations with North Korea are a persistent challenge. While 2025 has been relatively uneventful, the year before saw heightened tensions as Kim Jong Un escalated the rhetoric, and both sides spent months sending balloons and drones carrying propaganda materials across the border.\nSouth Korea's new leader must also balance Seoul's relations between its biggest trading partner, Beijing, and its most important security ally, Washington.\nThen there is the task of arresting the country's declining birth rate, which is among the lowest in the world - 0.75.\nWho could the next South Korean president be?\nPolls have placed Lee Jae-myung of the main opposition Democratic Party as the frontrunner among six candidates, followed by Kim Moon-soo from the ruling PPP.\nLee, who lost to Yoon by a razor-thin margin in 2022, is hailed by his supporters as a working class hero. He worked in a factory before he became a human rights lawyer and politician. He has promised to establish a \"real Republic of Korea\" with jobs and a fair society.\nKim, a former labour minister, has positioned himself as a president for the economy, promising to create a business-friendly environment.\nThe other candidates are Lee Jun-seok of the New Reform Party, Kwon Young-guk of the Democratic Labor Party and two independents - Hwang Kyo-ahn and Song Jin- ho.\nFor the first time in 18 years, there is no woman running for president. The first woman to run for president was Hong Suk-Ja in 1987, but she withdrew before the vote. The election in 2012 saw four female candidates contest for the top job.\nWhen is election day and when are results announced?\nThe election is scheduled on 3 June and voting precincts will be open from 06:00 local time (22:00 GMT) to 20:00. South Koreans overseas were allowed to vote early from 20 to 25 May.\nResults are expected to come in after polls close and the winner will likely be known  in the early hours of the following day.\nWhen Yoon defeated Lee in 2022, he was proclaimed the winner nine hours after the close of voting, or at 04:40 the morning after election day.\nThat was the closest presidential contest in the country's history, which saw Yoon win by a 0.73% difference in votes.\nThe new president will take office immediately and unlike many of his predecessors, will not have the advantage of a formal transition from Yoon.\nWhat will happen to impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol?\nYoon faces trial for an insurrection charge as a result of his attempt to impose martial law.\nIn January this year he became South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested after investigators scaled barricades and cut through barbed wire to take him into custody. He was...",

    "date": "2025-05-26T22:57:38.881Z",
    "content": "From prodigy to leader: Can Shubman Gill shape the future of Indian Test cricket?\n10 hours ago\nShare\nSave\nAyaz Memon\nCricket writer\nShare\nSave\nNearly three weeks after Rohit Sharma's sudden retirement from Test cricket, the Indian cricket board has ended speculation of his successor by naming Shubman Gill as India's new captain for the upcoming five-Test series against England in June.\nAt 25,\nGill becomes India's 37th Test captain\n- and one of its youngest, after Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, Sachin Tendulkar, Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri.\nHis appointment marks a turning point for Indian cricket. The squad he leads is without batting greats Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, spin stalwart R Ashwin who retired six months ago, and pace spearhead Mohammed Shami, who was sidelined due to fitness concerns.\nThe team is rich in young batting talent but will miss the experience of Kohli and Sharma. Despite Jaspreet Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, and Mohammad Siraj, the bowling attack still feels a touch raw.\nAdding to Gill's challenge: India haven't won a Test series in England since 2007.\nHis appointment followed intense deliberations between chief selector Ajit Agarkar, coach Gautam Gambhir, and backchannel talks with other contenders.\nThough Bumrah seemed the natural choice after serving as vice-captain in Australia, concerns over his ability to shoulder the workload of a five-Test series tipped the scales in Gill's favour.\nA prodigy from Punjab state, Gill has long carried the weight of expectation with elegance.\nHe burst into the spotlight in 2014, not yet 15, hammering 351 in a world-record opening stand of 587 with Nirmal Singh in the Punjab Inter-District ML Markan Trophy. It was a knock that vindicated his family's bold move from the border village of Chak Kherewala to Mohali, seeking better training and greater exposure for the young talent.\nConsistent run-getting as a junior, fast-tracked him into the under-19 ranks which is where Gill really made his first big impact.\nVice-captain of the team that played the 2017-18 U-19 World Cup, he emerged as the top run aggregator for India, highlighted by a skilful, unbeaten 102 against arch rivals Pakistan in the semi-final. In the final where India beat Australia, Gill scored a handy 31.\nAt the time, all eyes were on Prithvi Shaw - the U-19 captain whose Mumbai schoolboy feats drew comparisons with Tendulkar. His rise was meteoric: a Test debut century, another soon after. But by 2020, his career had begun to unravel.\nTemporarily sidelined, Gill made an immediate impact on his Ranji Trophy debut with a half-century, followed by a century. Under Yuvraj Singh's mentorship, he sharpened both his batting and game awareness.\nProlific runs pushed selectors to consider Gill as Shaw's replacement. He debuted in Tests in Melbourne, December 2020, during India's memorable comeback series win.\nTall and graceful, Gill's technical precision and elegant stroke play - especially front of the wicket - set him apart as a promising young talent. Nicknamed the 'Prince' by his family, the title soon became his cricketing identity. Hailed as the Next Big Thing, he's widely tipped to succeed Virat Kohli as the next generation's leading batsman.\nThat promise remains unproven. Like Kohli, Gill is an all-format player, but unlike Kohli's early dominance, Gill has yet to display the same ambition and match-winning impact - especially in Tests, where his 1,893 runs in 32 matches are solid but not outstanding.\nGill's first captaincy, less than five years after his Test debut, comes at a crucial point in his career.\nWith enough international experience to elevate his batting from good to great, he now faces a stern test against England's Bazball style of play in challenging conditions. Success here would be a major boost to his standing as a top Test player.\nBut it is as captain that Gill probably faces tougher challenges.\nThe England series kicked off India's new World Test Championship cycle, following two finals appearances but a disappointing early exit in the last one. India's recent Test form has been poor, with back-to-back series losses to New Zealand and Australia.\nTo pull India out of the current rut, Gill will have to lead the way as batter as well as captain in charge of a new-look team, whose dressing-room and dynamics he will have to understand and, perhaps, reshape.\n\"Gill is a young man we are investing in not just for one series, but for the next five-six years to take Indian cricket ahead,'' said chief selector Ajit Agarkar.\nThat should be a tremendous reassurance for the new captain. While his appointment brings its share of pressure, it also carries immense hope - and an opportunity to carve his own legacy in Indian cricket history.\nIndia",

It is very important he is here,\" said Theresa McKnight, from Mississauga, Ontario.\nHer sister Dianne St Louis, from near Toronto, agreed: \"It's critical. It means a great deal to have the King standing side by side with Canadians.\"\nThere had been a warm welcome at Ottawa airport, for what will be a visit of about 24 hours on the ground in Canada.\nCarney was on the runway to meet the royal visitors, with a welcoming party that included schoolchildren from English- and French-speaking schools and representatives of First Nations communities.\nA community event had also been a checklist of Canadian moments, such as the King dropping a puck to start a game of street hockey and getting jars of maple syrup.\nBut the main focus of this trip will be the historic speech on Tuesday, with the prospect of the King delivering the Canadian government's message of rejecting calls to become the US 51st state.\nIt is also a diplomatic balancing act because in his role as head of state of the UK, the King has been part of an effort to keep good relations with Trump, including inviting him for a second state visit.\nBut in Canada, the King will have to speak on behalf of Canada.

It has major production plants  in Sweden, Belgium, China and the US.\nThe company was sold by US motor industry giant Ford to China's Geely in 2010.\nIn 2021, Volvo said all of its cars would go electric by 2030. Last year it scaled back that ambition due to a number of issues including \"additional uncertainties created by recent tariffs on EVs in various markets\".\nJapanese car maker\nNissan said earlier this month that it will cut another 11,000 jobs globally\nand shut seven factories as it shakes up the business in the face of weak sales.\nFalling sales in China and heavy discounting in the US, its two biggest markets, have taken a heavy toll on earnings, while a proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi collapsed in February.\nThe latest cutbacks brought the total number of layoffs announced by the company in the past year to about 20,000, or 15% of its workforce.\nIn an example of the cutthroat rivalry between carmakers, Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD announced at the weekend that it would cut the prices of more than 20 of its models.\nThe move brings the price of its cheapest car, the Seagull EV, to as low as 55,800 yuan ($7,745; £5,700).\nIn response Chinese government-owned Changan and Leapmotor, which is backed by Chrysler owner Stellantis, announced their own price cuts.\nShares in Chinese car makers fell sharply after those announcements.\nIn April, BYD outsold Elon Musk's Tesla in Europe for the first time, according to car industry research firm Jato Dynamics.\nInternational Business\nCar industry",

Right-wing activists held banners that read \"67 - Jerusalem in our hands; 2025 - Gaza in our hands\".\nArab traders in the Muslim Quarter who had yet to close their shops were harassed by young Israeli men, witnesses said.\nChants of \"May your village burn\" and \"Your home will be ours\" were heard throughout the march.\nAggressive marchers were detained and removed from the Old City by Israeli police.\nNational security minister Itamar Ben Gvir, of the Jewish Power party, called for the death penalty for \"terrorists\" in an address to the crowds.\nGvir also visited the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam and known by Jews as the Temple Mount. Jews revere it as the location of two Biblical Temples and it is the holiest site in Judaism.\nThe compound is administered by a Jordanian Islamic trust. Jews are allowed to visit but not pray there.\nA spokesman for the Palestinian presidency, based in the West Bank, condemned the march and Ben Gvir's visit to Al-Aqsa.\nIsrael's ongoing war in Gaza, \"repeated incursions into the Al-Aqsa mosque compound and provocative acts such as raising the Israeli flag in occupied Jerusalem threaten the stability of the entire region,\" Nabil Abu Rudeineh said in a statement.\nIn a cabinet meeting on Monday morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to keep Jerusalem \"united, whole, and under Israeli sovereignty\".\nLeft-wing opposition leader Yair Golan described images of violence in the Old City as \"shocking\".\n\"This is what hatred, racism and bullying look like,\" he said in a statement on X.\n\"We will fight for Jerusalem for all of us, Jews, Christians and Muslims, secular and religious.\n\"Jerusalem belongs to all those who love her. We will fight for her and restore her as a city for us all.\"\nLapid, another opposition leader, added: \"There is nothing Jewish about this violence. The government ministers who remain silent in the face of these events are complicit in this disgrace.\"\nEvery year thousands of Israelis march a route through Jerusalem and the annexed Old City, ending at the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews are allowed to pray in Jerusalem. On Sunday, a large Israeli flag was unfurled at the Western Wall plaza.\nThe parade marks Israel's capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and the \"unification\" of a city that the Israeli government says is their eternal capital.\nPalestinians also want Jerusalem as their future capital and much of the international community regards East Jerusalem as Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory.\nThis year's Flag March again coincided with the war in Gaza and\nescalating Israeli\nmilitary operations against Palestinian militants in the West Bank.\nIsrael launched a military campaign in Gaza in response to Hamas's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Fifty-seven are still being held, about 20 of whom are assumed to be alive.\nAt least 53,939 people, including at least 16,500 children, have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.\nYoung girl escapes burning Gaza school after Israeli attack\nIsrael & the Palestinians\nIsrael-Gaza war\nIsrael\nPalestinian territories\nJerusalem",

Today, there are growing concerns that this is being ignored.\nWhile the constitution requires regional representation in cabinet positions, the broader distribution of other prominent roles has traditionally followed a convention aimed at fostering national cohesion.\nNigeria's fractious divisions have in the past torn the country – Africa's most populous – apart.\nConcerns about fairness in presidential appointments are not new, but a chorus of criticism is growing over President Bola Tinubu's picks, with some accusing the head of state – who has been in power for two years – of favouring people from his own Yoruba ethnic group.\nThe presidency vehemently denies the accusation.\nThere have long been fears that members of one ethnic group would come to dominate key positions – and this means that presidential appointments are closely scrutinised whenever they are announced.\nThere are over 250 ethnic groups in the country with Hausa-Fulanis, Igbo and Yoruba – hailing from the north, south-east and south-west respectively - being the three largest.\nCritics say that Tinubu, a southern Muslim, showed signs of ignoring precedent from the onset when he picked another Muslim (although from the north) to be his running mate for the last election.\nSince the return of democracy in 1999, the major parties had always put forward a mixed Muslim-Christian ticket, as the country is roughly evenly divided between followers of the two religions.\nTinubu's appointments since becoming president in May 2023 are facing growing cricisim.\nAlthough there are dozens of roles for a head of state to fill, there are eight jobs that \"are the most crucial for every administration\", according to political analyst and barrister Lawal Lawal.\nThese are the heads of the:\ncentral bank\nstate-owned oil company, NNPC\npolice\narmy\ncustoms service\nintelligence agency\nanti-corruption agency and\nrevenue service.\nThere is no constitutional ranking of positions, but collectively these roles control the key financial and security apparatus of the country.\nEvery president inherits his predecessor's appointees, but has the prerogative to replace them.\nAs of April, all eight positions under Tinubu are now filled by Yorubas.\nThe recent\nappointment of former Shell boss Bayo Ojulari\nto head the state-owned oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), in place of a northerner turbocharged the debate about the apparent monopoly of one group in top positions.\nLooking at who filled the same posts under Tinubu's two immediate predecessors, there was no such dominance of one ethnic group at the same stage of their presidencies.\nGoodluck Jonathan – who served from 2010 to 2015 – had a relatively balanced team of two ethnic Fulanis, two Hausas, one Atyap, one Igbo, one Yoruba and one Calabar.\nWhen it came to Muhammadu Buhari – in power from 2015 to 2023 – the situation was less clear.\nIn the top eight he had three Hausas, two Kanuris, one Igbo, one Yoruba and one Nupe.\nBut in the minds of many Nigerians, Hausas, Kanuris and Nupes are all seen as northerners – and therefore there was a perception that Buhari, who is from the north, showed favouritism.\nSome argue that Tinubu's appointments have merely continued the trend, but the 100%-Yoruba make-up of the eight key positions is unprecedented.\n\"For a democratically elected president, I cannot remember at any point in Nigerian history where you have this high concentration of a particular ethnic group holding most of the sensitive positions,\" history professor Tijjani Naniya told the BBC.\nThis is not just about what has happened in the past but it could have an impact on the unity and even the future of the country, the professor said.\n\"For me, the fear is what if the next president continues on this path and picks most of the sensitive positions from his ethnic group, it diminishes the feeling of belonging among the rest and also reduces belief in democracy,\" he said.\nIn the last two years, many northerners, mostly Hausa-Fulanis, have looked at the apparent direction of travel with alarm.\nThe current men (there are no women) in charge of the NNPC, the police, customs and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) all replaced northerners.\nThe removal of Abdulrasheed Bawa, a Hausa, as boss of the EFCC in 2023 just two years after he was appointed was especially controversial.\nHe was arrested, accused of abuse of office and detained for over 100 days before the charges were dropped.\nHe was replaced by Ola Olukoyode, an ethnic Yoruba.\nSome from the north felt Mr Bawa was unfairly treated and pushed aside to make way for Mr Olukoyode.\n\"The president needs to know that the Yoruba people are just a part of the...",

    "content": "An Indian teacher was killed - then he got falsely labelled a \"terrorist\"\n1 day ago\nShare\nSave\nCherylann Mollan\nBBC News, Mumbai\nShare\nSave\nFarooq Ahmed still bristles with anger when he talks about his brother's death.\nMohammad Iqbal, a resident of Poonch city in Indian-administered Kashmir, died in cross-border shelling on 7 May, the morning after India\nlaunched a series of air strikes\nin Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in retaliation to a militant attack in the town of Pahalgam that killed 26 people. Pakistan has denied having any role in the attack.\nMr Ahmed says that Iqbal died where he had worked for more than two decades - Zia-ul-Uloom, a madrassa, or a religious centre focused on Islamic teachings, in Poonch.\nBut his death, it turned out, was just the beginning of the family's troubles.\nAs the news spread, several media channels falsely accused Iqbal of being a terrorist, following which the police put out a statement refuting the claim.\n\"My brother was a teacher but they saw his beard and skullcap and branded him a terrorist,\" Mr Ahmed says.\n\"It was like having salt rubbed into our wounds. We had lost Iqbal and then the media defamed him. The dead can't defend themselves.\"\nIndian officials say that a total of 16 people, including Iqbal, were killed in the cross-border shelling during the four-day military conflict that broke out between India and Pakistan following the airstrikes.\nPakistan has claimed 40 civilian deaths, though, it remains unclear how many of these were directly caused by the shelling.\nThe two nuclear-armed countries have shared a tense relationship for decades, as both administer the Himalayan region of Kashmir\nin part, but claim it in full\n.\nThey have fought three wars over Kashmir since independence from Britain in 1947 and\ncame back from the brink of another one\nearlier this month.\nBut as the military conflict escalated, another battle played out on social media - a\ndisinformation war of claims and counterclaims\nthat circulated online and on TV.\nJust like rumours about Iqbal's identity, other misleading and inaccurate information also found its way into some mainstream news channels and websites.\nThis included claims such as India having destroyed Pakistan's Karachi port, which was later debunked by the Indian government.\nSome of the other fabrications were harder to spot, like an AI-generated video of a Pakistan army general claiming that his country had lost two aircraft in combat.\n\"The scale of misinformation and fact-free assertions being broadcast by the media was shocking,\" says Manisha Pande, managing editor at Newslaundry, an independent news platform.\nShe notes that while a degree of sensationalism is expected as channels compete for viewership, \"the jingoistic and irresponsible coverage\" of the conflict was unprecedented in its intensity — and unlike anything she had witnessed before.\nNo one knows this better than Mr Ahmed.\n\"I don't know where news channels got the information about my brother from,\" Mr Ahmed says.\n\"Who did they speak to? What kind of evidence did they have that my brother was a terrorist?\" he asks.\nWeeks later, the family is still reeling from the tragedy.\nMr Ahmed says that on 7 May, his brother left home for the madrassa in the morning as usual, but it was his body that returned home. By noon, they had buried him in a nearby cemetery.\nFor some time, the family had no idea about the misinformation that was being shared by some news outlets. They were busy performing Iqbal's last rites.\nIt was only hours later that a relative received a WhatsApp forward - a video clip of a prominent news channel claiming that the Indian army had killed a terrorist, with Iqbal's photo flashing on the screen.\n\"We were shocked. Soon, we began getting more calls from people asking us what was going on and why was the media calling Iqbal a terrorist,\" Mr Ahmed says.\nThe claim was shared by some prominent channels, including Zee News, ABP and News18. The BBC has reached out to the channels for comment.\nOne channel claimed that Iqbal was killed in an \"Indian strike on a terrorist camp\" in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and that he was a terrorist with Pakistan-based terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba.\n\"Our family members have been staying in Poonch for generations. How can they say my brother was living in Pakistan? They [the media] should be ashamed,\" Mr Ahmed says.\nThe accusation against Iqbal was circulated so widely and swiftly that on 8 May, the Poonch police put out a statement, clarifying that Iqbal had died in cross-border shelling in the madrasa.\n\"Poonch Police strongly refutes such false narratives. The deceased, Maulana Mohd Iqbal, was a respected religious figure in the local community and had no affiliation with any terror outfit,\" the statement said, adding that legal action would be taken against any media outlet or individual who circulated the fake news.\nBut for Mr Ahmed, the statement was too little too late.\n\"By then, the false claim would've already...",

    "content": "'My life was saved by a stranger on the other side of the world'\n4 hours ago\nShare\nSave\nFi Lamdin & Emma Petrie\nBBC News\nShare\nSave\nA man with a rare form of blood cancer has travelled 10,000 miles to meet the stranger who saved his life.\nLuke Melling, 31, from Melbourne, Australia, says he was \"staring death in the face\" before receiving a stem-cell transplant from Alastair Hawken, of Grantham, Lincolnshire.\nThe match between the pair was so perfect that the men now believe they could be distantly related, as both their families hail from Preston, Lancashire – the town they chose for their emotional first meeting.\nThey are sharing their story to encourage more people to join the NHS Stem Cell Donor Registry.\nThree years ago, Luke, who was then 28, was desperately ill in hospital with Hodgkin lymphoma.\nHe had been living with the condition since he was 16 and, despite being in remission four times, the cancer kept coming back.\nAfter exhausting all other treatments, he was told he needed a transplant of stem cells – which can be found in the bone marrow and produce essential blood cells – to survive.\nBut no-one in his family, and no-one in Australia, was a match, so doctors started searching global stem-cell registries for a donor.\n\"It was pretty much like, 'This is it – this is the only option you have. It's either this or you're going to die',\" Luke says.\n\"Finding out that my sister wasn't a match was terrifying – we just didn't know if there would be anybody registered who would be a suitable match for me.\"\nBut then, after a six-month wait, Luke was told there was hope. The register had discovered a potential donor on the other side of the world.\n\"When we found out we had the perfect match, that was an emotional moment,\" Luke recalls. \"I remember mum – she was in hysterics, crying.\"\nFor Alastair, then 48, the phone call came out of the blue. A regular blood donor, he had signed up to the NHS registry in 2008.\nWhen he was asked if he was still willing to donate, the father-of-three did not hesitate.\n\"It was no problem at all,\" he says. \"What can I do, where can I be? It was nice to be wanted, or to feel that I could be of use to someone.\"\nBefore the donation, Alastair was injected with a high-strength cell-generating drug. After a couple of days he could barely move, but he was told that showed the process was working and the body was \"over-generating stem cells\".\nHe then went to a hospital for the stem cells to be \"harvested\" in a process similar to blood donation, while he was fed snacks and watched television.\n\"There's no discomfort,\" he says. \"The stem cells are taken out and packaged up, and then they're counted in the laboratory – 85 million is what we needed for Luke,  and that's what was taken.\n\"I felt amazing – my body was made up of fresh stem cells – and then my [harvested] stem cells went on their journey.\"\nThe cells were cryogenically frozen within hours to be sent to Australia, where Luke was waiting.\nLuke had his transplant a month later, but all he knew about the donor was that he was a 48-year-old man from the UK.\nHe was not allowed to contact Alastair until two years had passed and the treatment was considered successful.\nAt that point, Alastair did not know whether Luke had survived.\n\"I just hoped. I hoped and prayed that he had,\" he says.\nAnd then an email dropped into his inbox via the stem cell registry.\n\"It was like all my Christmases had come at once,\" Alastair recalls. \"It was a really beautiful moment.\"\nThe men were put in contact with each other and finally met in Preston on Friday.\nLuke told Alastair: \"To have someone like you, who is so beautiful, lovely and kind, having done all this, I'm glad it's your cells. I just can't thank you enough.\"\nFor his part, Alastair, who runs a gingerbread business, describes the donation as his \"legacy\".\nHe told Luke: \"If I achieve nothing more than just seeing that smile on your face, then I've achieved everything I need to achieve.\"\nPreston was a fitting place to meet as Alastair's grandparents lived in the town and Luke's family also have roots there.\nLuke, who is now 31 and back to full health, feels he can put the last 15 years behind him. He has even run a marathon.\n\"Meeting Alastair in person is a dream come true,\" he says. \"What do you say to the person who has given you your life back by literally giving a part of themselves?\n\"Me being able to get on that plane and fly across the world is possible only because of him.\n\"The moment I got to give him that huge hug and thank him in person is a moment I'll never forget.\"\nAlastair, now 51, hopes their story will encourage others to sign up to the stem cell registry.\n\"Meeting Luke today really brings home just what a difference that simple act can make,\" he says.\n\"I just wish more people would put themselves forward to be on the register to donate, whether it's platelets or organs or blood or stem cells – that is just the gift of life.\n\"There's nothing that makes you feel more complete as a h...",

    "content": "The people who think AI might become conscious\n1 day ago\nShare\nSave\nPallab Ghosh\nScience correspondent\n•\n@BBCPallab\nShare\nSave\nListen to this article.\nI step into the booth with some trepidation. I am about to be subjected to strobe lighting while music plays – as part of a research project trying to understand what makes us truly human.\nIt's an experience that brings to mind the test in the science fiction film Bladerunner, designed to distinguish humans from artificially created beings posing as humans.\nCould I be a robot from the future and not know it? Would I pass the test?\nThe researchers assure me that this is not actually what this experiment is about. The device that they call the \"Dreamachine\", after the\npublic programme\nof the same name, is designed to study how the human brain generates our conscious experiences of the world.\nAs the strobing begins, and even though my eyes are closed, I see swirling two-dimensional geometric patterns. It's like jumping into a kaleidoscope, with constantly shifting triangles, pentagons and octagons. The colours are vivid, intense and ever-changing: pinks, magentas and turquoise hues, glowing like neon lights.\nThe \"Dreamachine\" brings the brain's inner activity to the surface with flashing lights, aiming to explore how our thought processes work.\nThe images I'm seeing are unique to my own inner world and unique to myself, according to the researchers. They believe these patterns can shed light on consciousness itself.\nThey hear me whisper: \"It's lovely, absolutely lovely. It's like flying through my own mind!\"\nThe \"Dreamachine\", at Sussex University's\nCentre for Consciousness Science\n, is just one of many new research projects across the world investigating human consciousness: the part of our minds that enables us to be self-aware, to think and feel and make independent decisions about the world.\nBy learning the nature of consciousness, researchers hope to better understand what's happening within the silicon brains of artificial intelligence. Some believe that AI systems will soon become independently conscious, if they haven't already.\nBut what really is consciousness, and how close is AI to gaining it? And could the belief that AI might be conscious itself fundamentally change humans in the next few decades?\nFrom science fiction to reality\nThe idea of machines with their own minds has long been explored in science fiction. Worries about AI stretch back nearly a hundred years to the film Metropolis, in which a robot impersonates a real woman.\nA fear of machines becoming conscious and posing a threat to humans is explored in the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, when the HAL 9000 computer attacks astronauts onboard its spaceship. And in the final Mission Impossible film, which has just been released, the world is threatened by a powerful rogue AI, described by one character as a \"self-aware, self-learning, truth-eating digital parasite\".\nBut quite recently, in the real world there has been a rapid tipping point in thinking on machine consciousness, where credible voices have become concerned that this is no longer the stuff of science fiction.\nThe sudden shift has been prompted by the success of so-called large language models (LLMs), which can be accessed through apps on our phones such as Gemini and Chat GPT. The ability of the latest generation of LLMs to have plausible, free-flowing conversations has surprised even their designers and some of the leading experts in the field.\nThere is a growing view among some thinkers that as AI becomes even more intelligent, the lights will suddenly turn on inside the machines and they will become conscious.\nOthers, such as Prof Anil Seth who leads the Sussex University team, disagree, describing the view as \"blindly optimistic and driven by human exceptionalism\".\n\"We associate consciousness with intelligence and language because they go together in humans. But just because they go together in us, it doesn't mean they go together in general, for example in animals.\"\nSo what actually is consciousness?\nThe short answer is that no-one knows. That's clear from the good-natured but robust arguments among Prof Seth's own team of young AI specialists, computing experts, neuroscientists and philosophers, who are trying to answer one of the biggest questions in science and philosophy.\nWhile there are many differing views at the consciousness research centre, the scientists are unified in their method: to break this big problem down into lots of smaller ones in a series of research projects, which includes the Dreamachine.\nJust as the search to find the \"spark of life\" that made inanimate objects come alive was abandoned in the 19th Century in favour of identifying how individual parts of living systems worked, the Sussex team is now adopting the same approach to consciousness.\nThey hope to identify patterns of brain activity that explain various properties of conscious experiences, such as changes in electrical signals or blood flow...",

But social media users have decried the encounter as a serious invasion of privacy.\nNeither the student nor Gengdan Institute immediately responded to BBC News' requests for comment.\nBoth the student's video and the school's statement appear to have been taken down, though screenshots and snippets have been recirculated online, including by state media.\nOn Douyin, China's TikTok, a user claiming to be the student said her original account was suspended for 30 days for \"pornographic content\" after she posted the video.\nIn its statement dated 16 May, Gengdan Institute reportedly said the videos of the incident circulating online had been \"distorted\" - and that the institution had the right to pursue legal action against those who \"maliciously spread untrue videos\".\nThe statement also said that the staff had followed the proper procedure during the encounter, such as \"initiating clinical work after getting the student's permission\", and did not use tools or conduct a physical examination.\nIn the video, the staff member did not reply when the student asked for written proof of the school regulation to check students' menstrual status. She subsequently asked the student to go to a hospital instead.\nOn social media, the incident has triggered an outpouring of anger and sarcasm towards the school's rules.\n\"My head hurts, should I open my skull and call it a day?\" wrote one social media user.\n\"Let's just take the sanitary pad out and paste it on the sick note,\" another Weibo said.\nA staff member at Gengdan Institute told local outlet Dute News that the school may have created the rule about proving menstruation in order to deter students from faking periods to get sick notes.\nBut that argument has rung hollow among social media users.\n\"If they're worried about students using their periods as an excuse several times a month, why not simply make a record of it? It's not that complicated,\" one person wrote on Weibo.\nState media has also waded into the debate.\n\"Menstruation is already an intimate topic for women. Rules like this will make students feel very uncomfortable, and even negatively impact students' psychological wellbeing,\" reads an opinion piece from China National Radio.\nGengdan Institute now joins a list of tertiary institutions across the country that have come under fire for what many see as overbearing and ham-fisted attempts at controlling their students.\nLast year, some universities were criticised for banning the use of bed curtains in their dormitories. The curtains are often used by students for privacy in shared rooms, but school authorities said they were a fire and safety hazard.\nAdditionally, during the popular May Day holiday season last year, some universities issued strict guidelines for students who had planned to travel. These included avoiding solo trips, road trips, or cycling trips for safety - which many saw as the institutions overstepping their authority in students' private lives.\nOn social media site Xiaohongshu, a user claiming to be a student at Gengdan Institute said \"the school's clinic deserves all the criticism it's getting\".\n\"I heard from some older students that this kind of thing has been going on for a while. Some girls spoke up before, but nothing was done,\" the user wrote.\n\"I'm glad it made the trending topics this time.

    "content": "'Nowhere is safe' - Cameroonians trapped between separatists and soldiers\n1 day ago\nShare\nSave\nNick Ericsson\nBBC Africa Eye\nShare\nSave\nNgabi Dora Tue, consumed by grief, was barely able to stand on her own.\nThe coffin of her husband, Johnson Mabia, sat amid a crowd of stricken mourners in Limbe in Cameroon's South-West region - an area that had witnessed scenes like this many times before.\nWhile on a work trip, Johnson - an English-speaking civil servant - and five colleagues were captured by armed separatists.\nThe militants were - and still are - fighting for the independence of Cameroon's two anglophone regions in what is a predominantly francophone country. A near-decade-long conflict that has led to thousands of deaths and stunted life in the area.\nWhen he was abducted four years ago, Dora struggled to reach Johnson. When she eventually heard from separatist militants, they asked for a ransom of over $55,000 (£41,500) to be paid within 24 hours in order to secure his release. Dora then received another call from one of Johnson's relatives.\n\"He said…  that I should take care of the children. That my husband is no more. I didn't even know what to do. Tuesday he was travelling, and he was kidnapped. Friday he was killed,\" says Dora.\nThe separatists responsible had not just murdered but decapitated Johnson, and left his body on the road.\nThe roots of the separatist struggle lie in long-standing grievances that stretch back to full independence in 1961, and the formation of a single Cameroonian state in 1972 from former British and French territories.\nSince then the English-speaking minority have felt aggrieved at the perceived erosion of rights by the central government. Johnson was just an innocent by-stander, caught up in an increasingly brutal fight for self-determination and the government's desperate attempts to stamp out the uprising.\nThe current wave of violence began almost a decade ago.\nIn late 2016, peaceful protests started against what was perceived to be the creeping use of the francophone legal system in the region's courtrooms. The French- and English-speaking parts of Cameroon use different judicial systems.\nThe protests rapidly spread, and led to a call for the closing of shops and institutions.\nThe response of the security forces was immediate and severe - people were beaten, intimidated and there were mass arrests. The African Union called it \"a deadly and disproportionate use of violence\".\nCameroon's defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment on this or other issues in this article.\nArmed groups were set up. And, in late 2017 as tensions escalated, anglophone separatist leaders declared independence for what they called the Federal Republic of Ambazonia.\nTo date, five million anglophone Cameroonians have been dragged into the conflict - equivalent to one-fifth of the total population. At least 6,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands forced from their homes.\n\"We used to wake up in the morning to dead bodies on the streets,\" says Blaise Eyong, a journalist from Kumba in the English-speaking South-West region of Cameroon, who has produced and presented a documentary on the crisis for BBC Africa Eye, and was forced from his hometown with his family in 2019.\n\"Or you hear that a house has been set ablaze. Or you hear that someone was kidnapped. People's body parts chopped off. How do you live in a city where every single morning you're worried if your relatives are safe?\"\nThere have been a number of national and international attempts to resolve the crisis, including what the government called \"a major national dialogue\" in 2019.\nAlthough the talks established a special status for the country's two anglophone regions which acknowledged their unique history, very little was resolved in practical terms.\nFelix Agbor Nkongho - a barrister who was one of the leaders of the 2016 protests and was later arrested - says that with both sides now seeming to act with impunity, the moral high ground has disappeared.\n\"There was a time… where most people felt that, if they needed security, they would go to the separatists,\" he tells BBC Africa Eye.\n\"But over the last two years, I don't think any reasonable person would think that the separatists would be the ones to protect them. So everybody should die for us to have independence and I ask the question: who are you going to govern?\"\nBut it is not just the separatists who are accused of abuses.\nOrganisations such as Human Rights Watch have recorded the brutal response of the security forces to the anglophone independence movement. They have documented the burning of villages and the torture, unlawful arrests and extrajudicial killings of people in a war largely unseen by the outside world.\nExamples of state-sponsored brutality are not difficult to find.\nJohn (not his real name) and a close friend were taken into custody by Cameroonian military forces, accused of buying weapons for a separatist group.\nJohn recalls that after bein...",
