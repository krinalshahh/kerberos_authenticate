We seek to amplify the voices of the voiceless whilst bridging the gap between the Chinese and English languages.\nWe prioritise Hong Kong matters in our coverage, followed by China, Taiwan and Macau. In our coverage, we give special attention to under-represented, underprivileged or marginalised communities, such as reporting on issues facing low-income, ethnic or sexual minorities. HKFP has eight full-time staff \u2013 half of our audience is Hong Kong-based, whilst the rest reside overseas.\n10 Guiding Principles\n:\nHKFP will ensure the safety of staff and freelancers as a guiding, overriding concern in all of our work.\nHKFP will provide accurate, balanced and impartial news coverage, and correct errors quickly and transparently, upholding our Ethics Code.\nHKFP will not misrepresent information or quotes and will report truthfully. We will be transparent about our sources of information. We will never submit a story to a source for vetting.\nHKFP is answerable to only readers \u2013 our independence means we are able to resist censorship and self-censorship. As such, our language must be free of bias, influence and prejudice.\nHKFP should honour the trust of our sources and protect their confidentiality. We will seek their informed consent and never knowingly jeopardise their safety.\nHKFP should respect the presumption of innocence.\nHKFP should take care when dealing with victims or relatives who are grieving to avoid further trauma. We will seek parental consent when interviewing and taking photos of children.\nHKFP staff and freelancers do not use subterfuge or manipulation, nor violate privacy, to gather news. An editor may, however, approve an undercover investigation in light of safety reasons or the public interest. We will identify ourselves as HKFP journalists unless in exceptional, pre-approved circumstances or if there is a risk to safety.\nHKFP does not pay sources or use information gathered for personal benefit or financial gain.\nHKFP should be as transparent about our funding as possible. We will retain reserves to ensure the longevity of HKFP as a permanent fixture in the media landscape in the face of legal or existential uncertainty.\nBest Practices:\nActionable Feedback\nOur readers are frontline witnesses to life in Hong Kong \u2013 public safety, politics, housing, social issues, schools, and culture \u2013 and your insights can help shape our news agenda. We invite your news tips,\u00a0ideas, story or\u00a0source suggestions,\u00a0corrections, enquiries or complaints. We believe that news organisations have a responsibility to engage with the public on the values, issues, and ideas of the day and that we have much to gain in return.\nView our contact channels here.\nBylines\nand\nDatelines\nIn the interests of transparency and accountability, all of our news reports carry the reporter\u2019s name, biography and a headshot \u2013 or a joint byline if two journalists were equally involved.

      "content": "2020 has been a traumatic and confusing year for the best of us, but the lasting impact of\nthe Covid-19 pandemic\non children is easily overlooked. As part of our public service mission, HKFP commissioned a bilingual, copyright-friendly children\u2019s book to help youngsters in Hong Kong \u2013 and beyond \u2013 understand what is happening.\nBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\nwas illustrated by\nKitty N. Wong\n, written by Kitty and Daniel Levia, and includes a foreword by\nFull Cup Therapy\u2019s\nRachel Winston.\nDownload the book:\nLetter to parents \u2013\nclick to view\nWhen going through difficult times, parents often wonder and worry, \u201cWhat will be the impact of this on my child? How can I stop them from being traumatised?\u201d\nKitty N. Wong sought to produce a simple child friendly book to help reduce the traumatic impact of the recent pandemic upon children. Together with the experienced teacher and author Daniel Levia, we set out to make this happen.\nWhile the personal impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will vary, there is a common thread we are all experiencing; uncertainty. When we feel uncertain for prolonged periods of time it can set off feelings of fear and helplessness. It is hard for us to stay grounded but if we are lucky we may have learnt our own strategies for coping from the past that we can now draw upon. With limited life experience, and brains that are still developing, children depend upon us (their network of safe people) to lean upon. You are your child\u2019s most important resource!\nTwo very useful strategies for building your child\u2019s resilience are storytelling and fostering personal connection. Stories help children to make sense of their experiences and help them to recognise their own feelings, as well as the feelings of others. Feeling connected to our significant others is so important for regulating big emotions and having space to problem solve challenges in our daily lives. Snuggling up with your child to read this book ticks both of these resilience building boxes!\n\u201cBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\u201d is a heartfelt, hopeful and empowering story set in Asia. Bobby\u2019s story aims to help your child make sense of the pandemic and of the many feelings that may have come up as a result.\nBobby goes on an educational journey with Owl, releases his feelings and comes into a more empowered position. With the use of the reminder phrase PASS (Paws, Arms, Snouts & Spirits) helping your child to feel more empowered too.\nLastly, Owl holds a hopeful picture of the future while acknowledging the current challenges and difficult emotions. May we all try to embody this wise owl and hold the space for our children\u2019s emotions (however imperfectly). Of course this is not always possible and we too as adults need to seek out our own support systems at those times.\nBobby\u2019s story is an inspirational tale of how he was able to turn around his feelings of despair into hope. Through connection and with support he innovates new ways to play with and feel closer to his friends.\nWe hope that this book provides an opportunity for emotional connection for your child, as well as acting as a springboard for you as parents to have meaningful and productive conversations about this health crisis.\nRachel Winston\nRegistered Play & Creative Arts Therapist in Hong Kong\nfullcupplaytherapy.com\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English [PDF]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese [PDF]\nDownload\nDownload accompanying worksheets:\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Chinese worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nAdapt & translate:\nThe digital book is shared under a\nCC-BY-NC-SA: Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike (2020)\nCreative Commons license\n\u2013 it lets others remix, adapt, translate and build upon the book non-commercially, as long as new creations include full credits and the identical licence.\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nIf you have translated \u201cBobby\u201d into another language,\nplease get in touch\n, so we can share you work!\nVideo:\nTeam:\nKitty N.

      "content": "Dear readers and supporters,\nIdeas that HKFP could avoid some of the pressures faced by the rest of Hong Kong\u2019s independent media sector were dashed in 2024. Threats and harassment, official scrutiny from multiple government departments, pressure on our corporate partners, and false complaints to the authorities marked a bumpy year for our newsroom. We nevertheless battled our way through unscathed, reporting all cases of intimidation to the police and emerging with a strengthened determination to continue our work.\nFor the rest of Hong Kong, 2024 was equally eventful. It saw the passage of a\nnew security law\n, a\nprotest song banned\nand the departure of five\nforeign judges\nfrom the top court, whilst editors from the now-defunct Stand News were\njailed for sedition\n. Meanwhile, 45 democrats were\njailed over a democratic primary\n, the\nJournalist Association chair\nwas fired from the Wall Street Journal, Apple Daily founder\nJimmy Lai took the stand\nin court, and the city recorded the\nhottest year on record\n.\nOur team reported on every beat, with a bumper year for award nominations. HKFP was shortlisted for an International Press Institute\nFree Media Pioneer\naward and a Reporters Without Border\nPress Freedom Prize\n. We also won a\nprize for photography\n, for\ncourage and impact\n, and we were nominated for a prestigious\nSOPA in regional reporting\n.\nHaving previously bolstered our\nEthics Code\nand gained several\ncredibility hallmarks\n, we aim to join the\nJournalism Trust Initiative\nin 2025, as part of our commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness. We will also enrol with\nReporters Shield\nto insure us against any frivolous legal suits.\nThere will also be challenges ahead, as we mark 10 years of HKFP this June. With a HK$1.7m deficit predicted for 2024, we will need to reduce costs and increase our income. We will therefore launch half a dozen new benefits for our valued\nHKFP Patrons\n, in order to safeguard our team and output.\nDespite the bumpy ride, HKFP still has breathing room to report freely on any local, hard news story. We remain\ndedicated to Hong Kong\n, as we are still able to speak to sources on the ground and exercise privileges lost in mainland China: bearing witness in court and at the legislature, and asking tough, direct questions of officials.\nI am happy to present our Annual Report, as we round-up our best coverage, achievements, and accounts from the past 12 months \u2013 all made possible by our monthly donors. The price of a weekly coffee will help us\nkeep the lights on and return to sustainability over the coming year\n. And for those of you who are already HKFP Patrons, thank you for your kind support, and for helping keep independent media alive in Hong Kong.\nAnnual Report 2024:\nOur Mission & Impact\n.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024\n.\nHKFP Awards\n.\nEthics at HKFP\n.\nImpact & Positioning\n.\nStaff & Structure\n.\nTransparency Report 2024\n.\nPress Freedom in 2024\n.\nReader Survey\n.\nHow to Support HKFP\n.\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload the 2024 Annual Report [PDF]\nMission and impact:\nFounded in 2015, Hong Kong Free Press is an impartial, non-profit, award-winning English-language newspaper. Run by journalists, backed by readers and completely independent, HKFP is governed by a public code of ethics.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024:\nOriginal reporting\n: Hong Kong Free Press began 2024 not in its home city, but in Taipei, as voters headed to the polls to elect Taiwan\u2019s next leader. We spoke to\nyoung voters about their concerns\n, and Hongkongers who had moved there in the wake of the 2019 protests and were\ncasting their ballots for the first time\n.\nAhead of Lai-Ching-te\u2019s presidential inauguration, we sat down with Taiwan\u2019s outgoing foreign minister Joseph Wu, pro-Beijing figures, and academics to\ndiscuss the democratic island\u2019s uncertain future\n, and later\nlooked back at the Sunflower Movement\n10 years after students stormed the legislature to protest economic rapprochement with China.\nMost of our reporting, however, remained focused on issues that impacted Hongkongers. Mental health remained a major concern, as we explored the ways that mental health professionals and educators were seeking to\nstem an alarming rise in student suicides\n. When a man suffering from schizophrenia was shot dead by police at his home, his\nfamily told HKFP they could not understand why officers had been so quick to resort to firearms\n.\nIn an effort to gauge public opinion about major political developments \u2013 such as\nthe legislation of a new security law\n,\nDonald Trump\u2019s re-election as US president\n, and the\nopening of an exhibition dedicated to national security\n\u2013 we hit the streets to ask Hongkongers for their opinions.\nWe also spoke to social workers \u2013 whose field was the subject of a major government overhaul \u2013 about the lack of resistance to, or even discussion about, the changes within the sector. The\nsilence was a sign of the times in today\u2019s Hong Kong\n, they said, but uncharacteristic of the historically outspoken industry....",

      "content": "Hong Kong Free Press is proud to have gained the\nTrust Project\nhallmark \u2013 the first global transparency standard that proves a news outlet\u2019s commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness.\nThroughout this year, HKFP has been\npublicly disclosing and expanding its ethical policies, standards, reporting and corrections guidelines\nto adhere to the\neight Trust Indicators\n. The move seeks to improve media literacy and battle \u201cfake news,\u201d misinformation and\u00a0online propaganda.\nFirst adopted in March 2020,\nour newly-revamped guidelines\nlay out HKFP\u2019s mission, our priorities, our expectations for staff conduct and impartiality, as well as how we deal with issues such as AI, advertising, anonymity, balance, security, sourcing and issues of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and identity.\nWe now join around 300 newsrooms across the world displaying the Trust Mark symbol, including the BBC, Washington Post, Sky News, CTV and the Economist.\nWhat is the Trust Project? Click to view.\nThe Trust Project\nis an international consortium of news organisations building standards of transparency and working with technology platforms to affirm and amplify journalism\u2019s commitment to transparency, accuracy, inclusion and fairness so that the public can make informed news choices. It was founded and is led by award-winning journalist\nSally Lehrman.\nWhat are the 8 Trust Indicators?\n1. Best Practices \u2013 who is behind the news?\nIf a journalist\u2019s organization has rules they must follow to make sure their reporting is independent, accurate and honest, then their news will be more trustworthy.\nDoes the site use guidelines to protect honest and independent reporting?\nWhat is the site\u2019s mission and priorities?\nWho funds them?\n2. Journalist Expertise \u2013 who made this?\nWe are rarely there to see events in the news for ourselves, so we rely on the journalist. They should follow strict standards for gathering solid evidence and multiple perspectives.\nAre the journalist(s) credentials easily available?\nDo they have a good professional reputation as a journalist?\nAre they reporting on a topic or community they know well?\n3. Labels \u2013 news, opinion, or what?\nIt\u2019s important to know whether your news is impartial or deliberately biased. Stories should be clearly labelled if they are designed to persuade us to agree. If it\u2019s journalism, then it\u2019s meant to help us develop our\nown\nopinions.\nIs the story impartial or does it have a clear opinion?\nIs it highly partisan, sponsored or advertising something?\nIs the purpose clearly shown?\n4. References \u2013 what are the sources?\nWhen a journalist is developing a news story, they may use information from eye witnesses, documents and other places \u2013 called\nsources\n. When a journalist shows their sources, we can check their reliability for ourselves.\nFor investigative, in-depth or controversial stories, does the journalist provide sources for each claim?\nDo they give details so we can check the sources ourselves?\nDo other sources back up what is being said?\n5. Methods \u2013 why was it built?\nIf we know why a journalist chose a particular story and how they reported it, it\u2019s easier to interpret it. A journalist\u2019s methods help us know how fast-moving, well-researched or impartial the story may be.\nHow much reporting was done?\nWhat methods were used?\nWho else was involved in the process?\n6. Locally sourced \u2013 do they know you and your community?\nIf a journalist knows and lives in the community, they can explain an event or issue more sensitively and accurately. If not, they can improve their reporting by going there and speaking to others who have local and community knowledge.\nWas the reporting done with deep knowledge about the local situation or community?\nWas the journalist on the scene?\nDid the journalist make an effort to listen to members of the community?\n7. Diverse voices \u2013 who is in the news, who is missing?\nIf certain voices or experiences are missing from the news, we don\u2019t get the full picture. Look for voices less commonly heard in society, often because of race, class, generation, gender, sexual orientation, ideology or the region they live in.\nDoes the newsroom commit to bringing in diverse perspectives?\nIs there evidence that the journalist pays attention to diversity?\nAre some communities included only in stereotypical ways, or completely missing?\n8. Actionable feedback \u2013 does this news site listen to me?\nBy inviting and listening to public feedback, journalists can make sure their work is accurate and complete. The public also might help them find important news they had overlooked.\nDoes the news site invite the public to participate?\nDo they ask for feedback?\nDo they correct errors quickly, clearly and prominently?\nHKFP Policies, Ethics Code & Best Practices:\nClick to view our newly-revamped and expanded guidelines:\nAnnual Report\n.\nAwards\n.\nCommunity Guidelines\n.\nFreelance Charter\n.\nFunding\n.\nGuiding Principles\n.\nPlatforms\n.\nSecurity Law\n.\nStaff Roster\n.\nTransparency Report\n....",

We have no shareholders, and we do not answer to any business tycoon, government, mainland conglomerate or media mogul. HKFP is run by journalists and is a non-profit \u2013 we are answerable only to ourselves and our readers, and\nour newsroom relies on small donations from 1,000 readers\n.\nIn 2024, costs rose following our expansion, whilst income fell amid waning interest in Hong Kong news, a population exodus, and a slowing economy. We invite our readers and supporters to examine our income and spending over the past year, as we look to return to sustainability in 2025.\nCheck out our full Annual Report here\n.\nIncome\nCurrent Revenue Streams\nSpending\nInvesting in People\nPatrons\nSupport HKFP\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload HKFP\u2019s Annual Report [PDF]\nHow is HKFP funded? Income 2016-2024\nOur finalised, externally audited income up to 2023, and our predicted income for 2024 \u2013 in HK$.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Reader supported:\n94% of HKFP\u2019s income comes directly from our readers, ensuring our press freedom and independence.\n\u267b\ufe0f Surplus recycled:\nAs a non-profit, with no shareholders, investors, billionaires or umbrella company overseeing it, any surplus is\nrecycled\nback into the HKFP newsroom for future use.\n\ud83d\udcc9\nCosts reduced\n: In 2024, HKFP slashed costs by switching insurers and merch store suppliers, downgrading software packages, adjusting staff transport allowances, finding sponsors for key costs, and halting most advertising. Given the tough environment for press freedom and the need to retain staff, HKFP vows to safeguard journalist salaries and headcount. Director pay was, however, frozen in 2022.\n\ud83d\udcc8\nNew income streams\n: HKFP launched a newly expanded commercial\nrate card\nin 2024, with over a dozen advertising offerings, as well as photo/video licencing, consultancy, workshop and sponsorship opportunities. We also signed content sales deals with the Copyright Clearance Center and ProRata.ai, and launched new HKFP merch lines to improve cashflow.\n\ud83d\udcb2\n2025 Patrons plan\n: To close the funding gap in 2025, HKFP will provide new benefits to monthly donors.\nCurrent Revenue Streams\nContributions\n: include one-off & monthly Patron contributions by cheque/transfer, cash, PayPal & Stripe credit/debit card (inc. Apple Pay & Google Pay), PayMe, Octopus, CoinDragon, as well as merch sales profit and shopping referral links.\nAds & content sales\n: include ad income from display ads; Apple News & Facebook ads, Google/YouTube ads, directly purchased rate card ads & content sales [from media outlets, institutions and syndication partners LexisNexis, Opera News, ProRata.ai, CCC, Moody\u2019s, NewsBank, ProQuest, Dow Jones Factiva & Nordot etc\u2026]\n\u26a0\ufe0f Record deficit:\nHKFP faced a predicted, record deficit of HK$1.72m in 2024. Although we are able to reinvest our previous surplus, we will need to work on a return to sustainability by further reducing costs and improving income in 2025.\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by\nsupporting our team\n\ud83e\ude99 Bitcoin:\nTo ease the financial situation in 2024, HKFP converted some of its Bitcoin investment into cash in order to pay a month of staff salaries and five months of office rent. 0.69 BTC was withdrawn into HK$506,630 as the exchange rate peaked, leaving 2.16 BTC invested. (Readers donated crypto between 2021-2022. It was declared to Inland Revenue, and retained as an investment, hence it does not appear as 2004 \u201cincome\u201d above. HKFP supports Hong Kong\u2019s moves to become a crypto hub and hopes to accept Bitcoin again soon.)\n\ud83d\udd12 Future security:\nAs of 2021, HKFP has retained a HK$1.5m legal defence fund in light of new challenges to press freedom, in addition to an emergency fund of HK$1m. As HKFP will be joining the\nReporters Shield\nprogramme in 2025 \u2013 which will provide some monetary protection against frivolous lawsuits \u2013 the company\u2019s legal fund will be reduced to HK$1m.\n\ud83d\udca1Efficiency:\nHKFP is run as efficiently and prudently as possible, in order to maximise the impact of our donors\u2019 generosity. We make savings by partnering with other media outlets, using free software/tools, and making full use of teamwork and automation.\n\ud83d\udcdd\nTo view our full audits,\nclick here.\nHKFP Spending 2016-2024\nFinalised expenditure for our latest audited year, 2024, & our predicted 2024 spending \u2013 in HK$.\nInvesting in People\n\ud83d\udcbc Investing in people:\nHKFP competes with international media when it comes to staff pay and conditions. We are proud to set \u2013 or exceed \u2013 industry standards in order to foster talent and retain staff in an increasingly tough environment. 78% of HKFP\u2019s spending goes towards staff remuneration and pensions.

We seek to amplify the voices of the voiceless whilst bridging the gap between the Chinese and English languages.\nWe prioritise Hong Kong matters in our coverage, followed by China, Taiwan and Macau. In our coverage, we give special attention to under-represented, underprivileged or marginalised communities, such as reporting on issues facing low-income, ethnic or sexual minorities. HKFP has eight full-time staff \u2013 half of our audience is Hong Kong-based, whilst the rest reside overseas.\n10 Guiding Principles\n:\nHKFP will ensure the safety of staff and freelancers as a guiding, overriding concern in all of our work.\nHKFP will provide accurate, balanced and impartial news coverage, and correct errors quickly and transparently, upholding our Ethics Code.\nHKFP will not misrepresent information or quotes and will report truthfully. We will be transparent about our sources of information. We will never submit a story to a source for vetting.\nHKFP is answerable to only readers \u2013 our independence means we are able to resist censorship and self-censorship. As such, our language must be free of bias, influence and prejudice.\nHKFP should honour the trust of our sources and protect their confidentiality. We will seek their informed consent and never knowingly jeopardise their safety.\nHKFP should respect the presumption of innocence.\nHKFP should take care when dealing with victims or relatives who are grieving to avoid further trauma. We will seek parental consent when interviewing and taking photos of children.\nHKFP staff and freelancers do not use subterfuge or manipulation, nor violate privacy, to gather news. An editor may, however, approve an undercover investigation in light of safety reasons or the public interest. We will identify ourselves as HKFP journalists unless in exceptional, pre-approved circumstances or if there is a risk to safety.\nHKFP does not pay sources or use information gathered for personal benefit or financial gain.\nHKFP should be as transparent about our funding as possible. We will retain reserves to ensure the longevity of HKFP as a permanent fixture in the media landscape in the face of legal or existential uncertainty.\nBest Practices:\nActionable Feedback\nOur readers are frontline witnesses to life in Hong Kong \u2013 public safety, politics, housing, social issues, schools, and culture \u2013 and your insights can help shape our news agenda. We invite your news tips,\u00a0ideas, story or\u00a0source suggestions,\u00a0corrections, enquiries or complaints. We believe that news organisations have a responsibility to engage with the public on the values, issues, and ideas of the day and that we have much to gain in return.\nView our contact channels here.\nBylines\nand\nDatelines\nIn the interests of transparency and accountability, all of our news reports carry the reporter\u2019s name, biography and a headshot \u2013 or a joint byline if two journalists were equally involved.

As part of our public service mission, HKFP commissioned a bilingual, copyright-friendly children\u2019s book to help youngsters in Hong Kong \u2013 and beyond \u2013 understand what is happening.\nBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\nwas illustrated by\nKitty N. Wong\n, written by Kitty and Daniel Levia, and includes a foreword by\nFull Cup Therapy\u2019s\nRachel Winston.\nDownload the book:\nLetter to parents \u2013\nclick to view\nWhen going through difficult times, parents often wonder and worry, \u201cWhat will be the impact of this on my child? How can I stop them from being traumatised?\u201d\nKitty N. Wong sought to produce a simple child friendly book to help reduce the traumatic impact of the recent pandemic upon children. Together with the experienced teacher and author Daniel Levia, we set out to make this happen.\nWhile the personal impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will vary, there is a common thread we are all experiencing; uncertainty. When we feel uncertain for prolonged periods of time it can set off feelings of fear and helplessness. It is hard for us to stay grounded but if we are lucky we may have learnt our own strategies for coping from the past that we can now draw upon. With limited life experience, and brains that are still developing, children depend upon us (their network of safe people) to lean upon. You are your child\u2019s most important resource!\nTwo very useful strategies for building your child\u2019s resilience are storytelling and fostering personal connection. Stories help children to make sense of their experiences and help them to recognise their own feelings, as well as the feelings of others. Feeling connected to our significant others is so important for regulating big emotions and having space to problem solve challenges in our daily lives. Snuggling up with your child to read this book ticks both of these resilience building boxes!\n\u201cBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\u201d is a heartfelt, hopeful and empowering story set in Asia. Bobby\u2019s story aims to help your child make sense of the pandemic and of the many feelings that may have come up as a result.\nBobby goes on an educational journey with Owl, releases his feelings and comes into a more empowered position. With the use of the reminder phrase PASS (Paws, Arms, Snouts & Spirits) helping your child to feel more empowered too.\nLastly, Owl holds a hopeful picture of the future while acknowledging the current challenges and difficult emotions. May we all try to embody this wise owl and hold the space for our children\u2019s emotions (however imperfectly). Of course this is not always possible and we too as adults need to seek out our own support systems at those times.\nBobby\u2019s story is an inspirational tale of how he was able to turn around his feelings of despair into hope. Through connection and with support he innovates new ways to play with and feel closer to his friends.\nWe hope that this book provides an opportunity for emotional connection for your child, as well as acting as a springboard for you as parents to have meaningful and productive conversations about this health crisis.\nRachel Winston\nRegistered Play & Creative Arts Therapist in Hong Kong\nfullcupplaytherapy.com\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English [PDF]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese [PDF]\nDownload\nDownload accompanying worksheets:\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Chinese worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nAdapt & translate:\nThe digital book is shared under a\nCC-BY-NC-SA: Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike (2020)\nCreative Commons license\n\u2013 it lets others remix, adapt, translate and build upon the book non-commercially, as long as new creations include full credits and the identical licence.\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nIf you have translated \u201cBobby\u201d into another language,\nplease get in touch\n, so we can share you work!\nVideo:\nTeam:\nKitty N.

      "content": "Dear readers and supporters,\nIdeas that HKFP could avoid some of the pressures faced by the rest of Hong Kong\u2019s independent media sector were dashed in 2024. Threats and harassment, official scrutiny from multiple government departments, pressure on our corporate partners, and false complaints to the authorities marked a bumpy year for our newsroom. We nevertheless battled our way through unscathed, reporting all cases of intimidation to the police and emerging with a strengthened determination to continue our work.\nFor the rest of Hong Kong, 2024 was equally eventful. It saw the passage of a\nnew security law\n, a\nprotest song banned\nand the departure of five\nforeign judges\nfrom the top court, whilst editors from the now-defunct Stand News were\njailed for sedition\n. Meanwhile, 45 democrats were\njailed over a democratic primary\n, the\nJournalist Association chair\nwas fired from the Wall Street Journal, Apple Daily founder\nJimmy Lai took the stand\nin court, and the city recorded the\nhottest year on record\n.\nOur team reported on every beat, with a bumper year for award nominations. HKFP was shortlisted for an International Press Institute\nFree Media Pioneer\naward and a Reporters Without Border\nPress Freedom Prize\n. We also won a\nprize for photography\n, for\ncourage and impact\n, and we were nominated for a prestigious\nSOPA in regional reporting\n.\nHaving previously bolstered our\nEthics Code\nand gained several\ncredibility hallmarks\n, we aim to join the\nJournalism Trust Initiative\nin 2025, as part of our commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness. We will also enrol with\nReporters Shield\nto insure us against any frivolous legal suits.\nThere will also be challenges ahead, as we mark 10 years of HKFP this June. With a HK$1.7m deficit predicted for 2024, we will need to reduce costs and increase our income. We will therefore launch half a dozen new benefits for our valued\nHKFP Patrons\n, in order to safeguard our team and output.\nDespite the bumpy ride, HKFP still has breathing room to report freely on any local, hard news story. We remain\ndedicated to Hong Kong\n, as we are still able to speak to sources on the ground and exercise privileges lost in mainland China: bearing witness in court and at the legislature, and asking tough, direct questions of officials.\nI am happy to present our Annual Report, as we round-up our best coverage, achievements, and accounts from the past 12 months \u2013 all made possible by our monthly donors. The price of a weekly coffee will help us\nkeep the lights on and return to sustainability over the coming year\n. And for those of you who are already HKFP Patrons, thank you for your kind support, and for helping keep independent media alive in Hong Kong.\nAnnual Report 2024:\nOur Mission & Impact\n.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024\n.\nHKFP Awards\n.\nEthics at HKFP\n.\nImpact & Positioning\n.\nStaff & Structure\n.\nTransparency Report 2024\n.\nPress Freedom in 2024\n.\nReader Survey\n.\nHow to Support HKFP\n.\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload the 2024 Annual Report [PDF]\nMission and impact:\nFounded in 2015, Hong Kong Free Press is an impartial, non-profit, award-winning English-language newspaper. Run by journalists, backed by readers and completely independent, HKFP is governed by a public code of ethics.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024:\nOriginal reporting\n: Hong Kong Free Press began 2024 not in its home city, but in Taipei, as voters headed to the polls to elect Taiwan\u2019s next leader. We spoke to\nyoung voters about their concerns\n, and Hongkongers who had moved there in the wake of the 2019 protests and were\ncasting their ballots for the first time\n.\nAhead of Lai-Ching-te\u2019s presidential inauguration, we sat down with Taiwan\u2019s outgoing foreign minister Joseph Wu, pro-Beijing figures, and academics to\ndiscuss the democratic island\u2019s uncertain future\n, and later\nlooked back at the Sunflower Movement\n10 years after students stormed the legislature to protest economic rapprochement with China.\nMost of our reporting, however, remained focused on issues that impacted Hongkongers. Mental health remained a major concern, as we explored the ways that mental health professionals and educators were seeking to\nstem an alarming rise in student suicides\n. When a man suffering from schizophrenia was shot dead by police at his home, his\nfamily told HKFP they could not understand why officers had been so quick to resort to firearms\n.\nIn an effort to gauge public opinion about major political developments \u2013 such as\nthe legislation of a new security law\n,\nDonald Trump\u2019s re-election as US president\n, and the\nopening of an exhibition dedicated to national security\n\u2013 we hit the streets to ask Hongkongers for their opinions.\nWe also spoke to social workers \u2013 whose field was the subject of a major government overhaul \u2013 about the lack of resistance to, or even discussion about, the changes within the sector. The\nsilence was a sign of the times in today\u2019s Hong Kong\n, they said, but uncharacteristic of the historically outspoken industry....",

      "content": "Hong Kong Free Press is proud to have gained the\nTrust Project\nhallmark \u2013 the first global transparency standard that proves a news outlet\u2019s commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness.\nThroughout this year, HKFP has been\npublicly disclosing and expanding its ethical policies, standards, reporting and corrections guidelines\nto adhere to the\neight Trust Indicators\n. The move seeks to improve media literacy and battle \u201cfake news,\u201d misinformation and\u00a0online propaganda.\nFirst adopted in March 2020,\nour newly-revamped guidelines\nlay out HKFP\u2019s mission, our priorities, our expectations for staff conduct and impartiality, as well as how we deal with issues such as AI, advertising, anonymity, balance, security, sourcing and issues of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and identity.\nWe now join around 300 newsrooms across the world displaying the Trust Mark symbol, including the BBC, Washington Post, Sky News, CTV and the Economist.\nWhat is the Trust Project? Click to view.\nThe Trust Project\nis an international consortium of news organisations building standards of transparency and working with technology platforms to affirm and amplify journalism\u2019s commitment to transparency, accuracy, inclusion and fairness so that the public can make informed news choices. It was founded and is led by award-winning journalist\nSally Lehrman.\nWhat are the 8 Trust Indicators?\n1. Best Practices \u2013 who is behind the news?\nIf a journalist\u2019s organization has rules they must follow to make sure their reporting is independent, accurate and honest, then their news will be more trustworthy.\nDoes the site use guidelines to protect honest and independent reporting?\nWhat is the site\u2019s mission and priorities?\nWho funds them?\n2. Journalist Expertise \u2013 who made this?\nWe are rarely there to see events in the news for ourselves, so we rely on the journalist. They should follow strict standards for gathering solid evidence and multiple perspectives.\nAre the journalist(s) credentials easily available?\nDo they have a good professional reputation as a journalist?\nAre they reporting on a topic or community they know well?\n3. Labels \u2013 news, opinion, or what?\nIt\u2019s important to know whether your news is impartial or deliberately biased. Stories should be clearly labelled if they are designed to persuade us to agree. If it\u2019s journalism, then it\u2019s meant to help us develop our\nown\nopinions.\nIs the story impartial or does it have a clear opinion?\nIs it highly partisan, sponsored or advertising something?\nIs the purpose clearly shown?\n4. References \u2013 what are the sources?\nWhen a journalist is developing a news story, they may use information from eye witnesses, documents and other places \u2013 called\nsources\n. When a journalist shows their sources, we can check their reliability for ourselves.\nFor investigative, in-depth or controversial stories, does the journalist provide sources for each claim?\nDo they give details so we can check the sources ourselves?\nDo other sources back up what is being said?\n5. Methods \u2013 why was it built?\nIf we know why a journalist chose a particular story and how they reported it, it\u2019s easier to interpret it. A journalist\u2019s methods help us know how fast-moving, well-researched or impartial the story may be.\nHow much reporting was done?\nWhat methods were used?\nWho else was involved in the process?\n6. Locally sourced \u2013 do they know you and your community?\nIf a journalist knows and lives in the community, they can explain an event or issue more sensitively and accurately. If not, they can improve their reporting by going there and speaking to others who have local and community knowledge.\nWas the reporting done with deep knowledge about the local situation or community?\nWas the journalist on the scene?\nDid the journalist make an effort to listen to members of the community?\n7. Diverse voices \u2013 who is in the news, who is missing?\nIf certain voices or experiences are missing from the news, we don\u2019t get the full picture. Look for voices less commonly heard in society, often because of race, class, generation, gender, sexual orientation, ideology or the region they live in.\nDoes the newsroom commit to bringing in diverse perspectives?\nIs there evidence that the journalist pays attention to diversity?\nAre some communities included only in stereotypical ways, or completely missing?\n8. Actionable feedback \u2013 does this news site listen to me?\nBy inviting and listening to public feedback, journalists can make sure their work is accurate and complete. The public also might help them find important news they had overlooked.\nDoes the news site invite the public to participate?\nDo they ask for feedback?\nDo they correct errors quickly, clearly and prominently?\nHKFP Policies, Ethics Code & Best Practices:\nClick to view our newly-revamped and expanded guidelines:\nAnnual Report\n.\nAwards\n.\nCommunity Guidelines\n.\nFreelance Charter\n.\nFunding\n.\nGuiding Principles\n.\nPlatforms\n.\nSecurity Law\n.\nStaff Roster\n.\nTransparency Report\n....",

      "content": "As Hong Kong\u2019s most transparent news outlet, HKFP is externally audited annually, sharing all of our accounts online\n. We have no shareholders, and we do not answer to any business tycoon, government, mainland conglomerate or media mogul. HKFP is run by journalists and is a non-profit \u2013 we are answerable only to ourselves and our readers, and\nour newsroom relies on small donations from 1,000 readers\n.\nIn 2024, costs rose following our expansion, whilst income fell amid waning interest in Hong Kong news, a population exodus, and a slowing economy. We invite our readers and supporters to examine our income and spending over the past year, as we look to return to sustainability in 2025.\nCheck out our full Annual Report here\n.\nIncome\nCurrent Revenue Streams\nSpending\nInvesting in People\nPatrons\nSupport HKFP\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload HKFP\u2019s Annual Report [PDF]\nHow is HKFP funded? Income 2016-2024\nOur finalised, externally audited income up to 2023, and our predicted income for 2024 \u2013 in HK$.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Reader supported:\n94% of HKFP\u2019s income comes directly from our readers, ensuring our press freedom and independence.\n\u267b\ufe0f Surplus recycled:\nAs a non-profit, with no shareholders, investors, billionaires or umbrella company overseeing it, any surplus is\nrecycled\nback into the HKFP newsroom for future use.\n\ud83d\udcc9\nCosts reduced\n: In 2024, HKFP slashed costs by switching insurers and merch store suppliers, downgrading software packages, adjusting staff transport allowances, finding sponsors for key costs, and halting most advertising. Given the tough environment for press freedom and the need to retain staff, HKFP vows to safeguard journalist salaries and headcount. Director pay was, however, frozen in 2022.\n\ud83d\udcc8\nNew income streams\n: HKFP launched a newly expanded commercial\nrate card\nin 2024, with over a dozen advertising offerings, as well as photo/video licencing, consultancy, workshop and sponsorship opportunities. We also signed content sales deals with the Copyright Clearance Center and ProRata.ai, and launched new HKFP merch lines to improve cashflow.\n\ud83d\udcb2\n2025 Patrons plan\n: To close the funding gap in 2025, HKFP will provide new benefits to monthly donors.\nCurrent Revenue Streams\nContributions\n: include one-off & monthly Patron contributions by cheque/transfer, cash, PayPal & Stripe credit/debit card (inc. Apple Pay & Google Pay), PayMe, Octopus, CoinDragon, as well as merch sales profit and shopping referral links.\nAds & content sales\n: include ad income from display ads; Apple News & Facebook ads, Google/YouTube ads, directly purchased rate card ads & content sales [from media outlets, institutions and syndication partners LexisNexis, Opera News, ProRata.ai, CCC, Moody\u2019s, NewsBank, ProQuest, Dow Jones Factiva & Nordot etc\u2026]\n\u26a0\ufe0f Record deficit:\nHKFP faced a predicted, record deficit of HK$1.72m in 2024. Although we are able to reinvest our previous surplus, we will need to work on a return to sustainability by further reducing costs and improving income in 2025.\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by\nsupporting our team\n\ud83e\ude99 Bitcoin:\nTo ease the financial situation in 2024, HKFP converted some of its Bitcoin investment into cash in order to pay a month of staff salaries and five months of office rent. 0.69 BTC was withdrawn into HK$506,630 as the exchange rate peaked, leaving 2.16 BTC invested. (Readers donated crypto between 2021-2022. It was declared to Inland Revenue, and retained as an investment, hence it does not appear as 2004 \u201cincome\u201d above. HKFP supports Hong Kong\u2019s moves to become a crypto hub and hopes to accept Bitcoin again soon.)\n\ud83d\udd12 Future security:\nAs of 2021, HKFP has retained a HK$1.5m legal defence fund in light of new challenges to press freedom, in addition to an emergency fund of HK$1m. As HKFP will be joining the\nReporters Shield\nprogramme in 2025 \u2013 which will provide some monetary protection against frivolous lawsuits \u2013 the company\u2019s legal fund will be reduced to HK$1m.\n\ud83d\udca1Efficiency:\nHKFP is run as efficiently and prudently as possible, in order to maximise the impact of our donors\u2019 generosity. We make savings by partnering with other media outlets, using free software/tools, and making full use of teamwork and automation.\n\ud83d\udcdd\nTo view our full audits,\nclick here.\nHKFP Spending 2016-2024\nFinalised expenditure for our latest audited year, 2024, & our predicted 2024 spending \u2013 in HK$.\nInvesting in People\n\ud83d\udcbc Investing in people:\nHKFP competes with international media when it comes to staff pay and conditions. We are proud to set \u2013 or exceed \u2013 industry standards in order to foster talent and retain staff in an increasingly tough environment. 78% of HKFP\u2019s spending goes towards staff remuneration and pensions. When you support HKFP, you can be assured that your contribution is going\ndirectly\ntowards local journalists \u2013 not to shareholders or a profit-making conglomerate.\n\ud83d\udcb5 Living Wage Employer:\nIn 2024, HKFP gained the Oxfam Living Wage Employer certification.\n\u2714\ufe0f\nStaff benefits include\n: \u2713 ...",

      "content": "2020 has been a traumatic and confusing year for the best of us, but the lasting impact of\nthe Covid-19 pandemic\non children is easily overlooked. As part of our public service mission, HKFP commissioned a bilingual, copyright-friendly children\u2019s book to help youngsters in Hong Kong \u2013 and beyond \u2013 understand what is happening.\nBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\nwas illustrated by\nKitty N. Wong\n, written by Kitty and Daniel Levia, and includes a foreword by\nFull Cup Therapy\u2019s\nRachel Winston.\nDownload the book:\nLetter to parents \u2013\nclick to view\nWhen going through difficult times, parents often wonder and worry, \u201cWhat will be the impact of this on my child? How can I stop them from being traumatised?\u201d\nKitty N. Wong sought to produce a simple child friendly book to help reduce the traumatic impact of the recent pandemic upon children. Together with the experienced teacher and author Daniel Levia, we set out to make this happen.\nWhile the personal impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will vary, there is a common thread we are all experiencing; uncertainty. When we feel uncertain for prolonged periods of time it can set off feelings of fear and helplessness. It is hard for us to stay grounded but if we are lucky we may have learnt our own strategies for coping from the past that we can now draw upon. With limited life experience, and brains that are still developing, children depend upon us (their network of safe people) to lean upon. You are your child\u2019s most important resource!\nTwo very useful strategies for building your child\u2019s resilience are storytelling and fostering personal connection. Stories help children to make sense of their experiences and help them to recognise their own feelings, as well as the feelings of others. Feeling connected to our significant others is so important for regulating big emotions and having space to problem solve challenges in our daily lives. Snuggling up with your child to read this book ticks both of these resilience building boxes!\n\u201cBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\u201d is a heartfelt, hopeful and empowering story set in Asia. Bobby\u2019s story aims to help your child make sense of the pandemic and of the many feelings that may have come up as a result.\nBobby goes on an educational journey with Owl, releases his feelings and comes into a more empowered position. With the use of the reminder phrase PASS (Paws, Arms, Snouts & Spirits) helping your child to feel more empowered too.\nLastly, Owl holds a hopeful picture of the future while acknowledging the current challenges and difficult emotions. May we all try to embody this wise owl and hold the space for our children\u2019s emotions (however imperfectly). Of course this is not always possible and we too as adults need to seek out our own support systems at those times.\nBobby\u2019s story is an inspirational tale of how he was able to turn around his feelings of despair into hope. Through connection and with support he innovates new ways to play with and feel closer to his friends.\nWe hope that this book provides an opportunity for emotional connection for your child, as well as acting as a springboard for you as parents to have meaningful and productive conversations about this health crisis.\nRachel Winston\nRegistered Play & Creative Arts Therapist in Hong Kong\nfullcupplaytherapy.com\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English [PDF]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese [PDF]\nDownload\nDownload accompanying worksheets:\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Chinese worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nAdapt & translate:\nThe digital book is shared under a\nCC-BY-NC-SA: Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike (2020)\nCreative Commons license\n\u2013 it lets others remix, adapt, translate and build upon the book non-commercially, as long as new creations include full credits and the identical licence.\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nIf you have translated \u201cBobby\u201d into another language,\nplease get in touch\n, so we can share you work!\nVideo:\nTeam:\nKitty N.

      "content": "Dear readers and supporters,\nIdeas that HKFP could avoid some of the pressures faced by the rest of Hong Kong\u2019s independent media sector were dashed in 2024. Threats and harassment, official scrutiny from multiple government departments, pressure on our corporate partners, and false complaints to the authorities marked a bumpy year for our newsroom. We nevertheless battled our way through unscathed, reporting all cases of intimidation to the police and emerging with a strengthened determination to continue our work.\nFor the rest of Hong Kong, 2024 was equally eventful. It saw the passage of a\nnew security law\n, a\nprotest song banned\nand the departure of five\nforeign judges\nfrom the top court, whilst editors from the now-defunct Stand News were\njailed for sedition\n. Meanwhile, 45 democrats were\njailed over a democratic primary\n, the\nJournalist Association chair\nwas fired from the Wall Street Journal, Apple Daily founder\nJimmy Lai took the stand\nin court, and the city recorded the\nhottest year on record\n.\nOur team reported on every beat, with a bumper year for award nominations. HKFP was shortlisted for an International Press Institute\nFree Media Pioneer\naward and a Reporters Without Border\nPress Freedom Prize\n. We also won a\nprize for photography\n, for\ncourage and impact\n, and we were nominated for a prestigious\nSOPA in regional reporting\n.\nHaving previously bolstered our\nEthics Code\nand gained several\ncredibility hallmarks\n, we aim to join the\nJournalism Trust Initiative\nin 2025, as part of our commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness. We will also enrol with\nReporters Shield\nto insure us against any frivolous legal suits.\nThere will also be challenges ahead, as we mark 10 years of HKFP this June. With a HK$1.7m deficit predicted for 2024, we will need to reduce costs and increase our income. We will therefore launch half a dozen new benefits for our valued\nHKFP Patrons\n, in order to safeguard our team and output.\nDespite the bumpy ride, HKFP still has breathing room to report freely on any local, hard news story. We remain\ndedicated to Hong Kong\n, as we are still able to speak to sources on the ground and exercise privileges lost in mainland China: bearing witness in court and at the legislature, and asking tough, direct questions of officials.\nI am happy to present our Annual Report, as we round-up our best coverage, achievements, and accounts from the past 12 months \u2013 all made possible by our monthly donors. The price of a weekly coffee will help us\nkeep the lights on and return to sustainability over the coming year\n. And for those of you who are already HKFP Patrons, thank you for your kind support, and for helping keep independent media alive in Hong Kong.\nAnnual Report 2024:\nOur Mission & Impact\n.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024\n.\nHKFP Awards\n.\nEthics at HKFP\n.\nImpact & Positioning\n.\nStaff & Structure\n.\nTransparency Report 2024\n.\nPress Freedom in 2024\n.\nReader Survey\n.\nHow to Support HKFP\n.\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload the 2024 Annual Report [PDF]\nMission and impact:\nFounded in 2015, Hong Kong Free Press is an impartial, non-profit, award-winning English-language newspaper. Run by journalists, backed by readers and completely independent, HKFP is governed by a public code of ethics.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024:\nOriginal reporting\n: Hong Kong Free Press began 2024 not in its home city, but in Taipei, as voters headed to the polls to elect Taiwan\u2019s next leader. We spoke to\nyoung voters about their concerns\n, and Hongkongers who had moved there in the wake of the 2019 protests and were\ncasting their ballots for the first time\n.\nAhead of Lai-Ching-te\u2019s presidential inauguration, we sat down with Taiwan\u2019s outgoing foreign minister Joseph Wu, pro-Beijing figures, and academics to\ndiscuss the democratic island\u2019s uncertain future\n, and later\nlooked back at the Sunflower Movement\n10 years after students stormed the legislature to protest economic rapprochement with China.\nMost of our reporting, however, remained focused on issues that impacted Hongkongers. Mental health remained a major concern, as we explored the ways that mental health professionals and educators were seeking to\nstem an alarming rise in student suicides\n. When a man suffering from schizophrenia was shot dead by police at his home, his\nfamily told HKFP they could not understand why officers had been so quick to resort to firearms\n.\nIn an effort to gauge public opinion about major political developments \u2013 such as\nthe legislation of a new security law\n,\nDonald Trump\u2019s re-election as US president\n, and the\nopening of an exhibition dedicated to national security\n\u2013 we hit the streets to ask Hongkongers for their opinions.\nWe also spoke to social workers \u2013 whose field was the subject of a major government overhaul \u2013 about the lack of resistance to, or even discussion about, the changes within the sector. The\nsilence was a sign of the times in today\u2019s Hong Kong\n, they said, but uncharacteristic of the historically outspoken industry....",

The move seeks to improve media literacy and battle \u201cfake news,\u201d misinformation and\u00a0online propaganda.\nFirst adopted in March 2020,\nour newly-revamped guidelines\nlay out HKFP\u2019s mission, our priorities, our expectations for staff conduct and impartiality, as well as how we deal with issues such as AI, advertising, anonymity, balance, security, sourcing and issues of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and identity.\nWe now join around 300 newsrooms across the world displaying the Trust Mark symbol, including the BBC, Washington Post, Sky News, CTV and the Economist.\nWhat is the Trust Project? Click to view.\nThe Trust Project\nis an international consortium of news organisations building standards of transparency and working with technology platforms to affirm and amplify journalism\u2019s commitment to transparency, accuracy, inclusion and fairness so that the public can make informed news choices. It was founded and is led by award-winning journalist\nSally Lehrman.\nWhat are the 8 Trust Indicators?\n1. Best Practices \u2013 who is behind the news?\nIf a journalist\u2019s organization has rules they must follow to make sure their reporting is independent, accurate and honest, then their news will be more trustworthy.\nDoes the site use guidelines to protect honest and independent reporting?\nWhat is the site\u2019s mission and priorities?\nWho funds them?\n2. Journalist Expertise \u2013 who made this?\nWe are rarely there to see events in the news for ourselves, so we rely on the journalist. They should follow strict standards for gathering solid evidence and multiple perspectives.\nAre the journalist(s) credentials easily available?\nDo they have a good professional reputation as a journalist?\nAre they reporting on a topic or community they know well?\n3. Labels \u2013 news, opinion, or what?\nIt\u2019s important to know whether your news is impartial or deliberately biased. Stories should be clearly labelled if they are designed to persuade us to agree. If it\u2019s journalism, then it\u2019s meant to help us develop our\nown\nopinions.\nIs the story impartial or does it have a clear opinion?\nIs it highly partisan, sponsored or advertising something?\nIs the purpose clearly shown?\n4. References \u2013 what are the sources?\nWhen a journalist is developing a news story, they may use information from eye witnesses, documents and other places \u2013 called\nsources\n. When a journalist shows their sources, we can check their reliability for ourselves.\nFor investigative, in-depth or controversial stories, does the journalist provide sources for each claim?\nDo they give details so we can check the sources ourselves?\nDo other sources back up what is being said?\n5. Methods \u2013 why was it built?\nIf we know why a journalist chose a particular story and how they reported it, it\u2019s easier to interpret it. A journalist\u2019s methods help us know how fast-moving, well-researched or impartial the story may be.\nHow much reporting was done?\nWhat methods were used?\nWho else was involved in the process?\n6. Locally sourced \u2013 do they know you and your community?\nIf a journalist knows and lives in the community, they can explain an event or issue more sensitively and accurately. If not, they can improve their reporting by going there and speaking to others who have local and community knowledge.\nWas the reporting done with deep knowledge about the local situation or community?\nWas the journalist on the scene?\nDid the journalist make an effort to listen to members of the community?\n7. Diverse voices \u2013 who is in the news, who is missing?\nIf certain voices or experiences are missing from the news, we don\u2019t get the full picture. Look for voices less commonly heard in society, often because of race, class, generation, gender, sexual orientation, ideology or the region they live in.\nDoes the newsroom commit to bringing in diverse perspectives?\nIs there evidence that the journalist pays attention to diversity?\nAre some communities included only in stereotypical ways, or completely missing?\n8. Actionable feedback \u2013 does this news site listen to me?\nBy inviting and listening to public feedback, journalists can make sure their work is accurate and complete. The public also might help them find important news they had overlooked.\nDoes the news site invite the public to participate?\nDo they ask for feedback?\nDo they correct errors quickly, clearly and prominently?\nHKFP Policies, Ethics Code & Best Practices:\nClick to view our newly-revamped and expanded guidelines:\nAnnual Report\n.\nAwards\n.\nCommunity Guidelines\n.\nFreelance Charter\n.\nFunding\n.\nGuiding Principles\n.\nPlatforms\n.\nSecurity Law\n.\nStaff Roster\n.\nTransparency Report\n....",

      "content": "2020 has been a traumatic and confusing year for the best of us, but the lasting impact of\nthe Covid-19 pandemic\non children is easily overlooked. As part of our public service mission, HKFP commissioned a bilingual, copyright-friendly children\u2019s book to help youngsters in Hong Kong \u2013 and beyond \u2013 understand what is happening.\nBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\nwas illustrated by\nKitty N. Wong\n, written by Kitty and Daniel Levia, and includes a foreword by\nFull Cup Therapy\u2019s\nRachel Winston.\nDownload the book:\nLetter to parents \u2013\nclick to view\nWhen going through difficult times, parents often wonder and worry, \u201cWhat will be the impact of this on my child? How can I stop them from being traumatised?\u201d\nKitty N. Wong sought to produce a simple child friendly book to help reduce the traumatic impact of the recent pandemic upon children. Together with the experienced teacher and author Daniel Levia, we set out to make this happen.\nWhile the personal impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will vary, there is a common thread we are all experiencing; uncertainty. When we feel uncertain for prolonged periods of time it can set off feelings of fear and helplessness. It is hard for us to stay grounded but if we are lucky we may have learnt our own strategies for coping from the past that we can now draw upon. With limited life experience, and brains that are still developing, children depend upon us (their network of safe people) to lean upon. You are your child\u2019s most important resource!\nTwo very useful strategies for building your child\u2019s resilience are storytelling and fostering personal connection. Stories help children to make sense of their experiences and help them to recognise their own feelings, as well as the feelings of others. Feeling connected to our significant others is so important for regulating big emotions and having space to problem solve challenges in our daily lives. Snuggling up with your child to read this book ticks both of these resilience building boxes!\n\u201cBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\u201d is a heartfelt, hopeful and empowering story set in Asia. Bobby\u2019s story aims to help your child make sense of the pandemic and of the many feelings that may have come up as a result.\nBobby goes on an educational journey with Owl, releases his feelings and comes into a more empowered position. With the use of the reminder phrase PASS (Paws, Arms, Snouts & Spirits) helping your child to feel more empowered too.\nLastly, Owl holds a hopeful picture of the future while acknowledging the current challenges and difficult emotions. May we all try to embody this wise owl and hold the space for our children\u2019s emotions (however imperfectly). Of course this is not always possible and we too as adults need to seek out our own support systems at those times.\nBobby\u2019s story is an inspirational tale of how he was able to turn around his feelings of despair into hope. Through connection and with support he innovates new ways to play with and feel closer to his friends.\nWe hope that this book provides an opportunity for emotional connection for your child, as well as acting as a springboard for you as parents to have meaningful and productive conversations about this health crisis.\nRachel Winston\nRegistered Play & Creative Arts Therapist in Hong Kong\nfullcupplaytherapy.com\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English [PDF]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese [PDF]\nDownload\nDownload accompanying worksheets:\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Chinese worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nAdapt & translate:\nThe digital book is shared under a\nCC-BY-NC-SA: Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike (2020)\nCreative Commons license\n\u2013 it lets others remix, adapt, translate and build upon the book non-commercially, as long as new creations include full credits and the identical licence.\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nIf you have translated \u201cBobby\u201d into another language,\nplease get in touch\n, so we can share you work!\nVideo:\nTeam:\nKitty N.

      "content": "Dear readers and supporters,\nIdeas that HKFP could avoid some of the pressures faced by the rest of Hong Kong\u2019s independent media sector were dashed in 2024. Threats and harassment, official scrutiny from multiple government departments, pressure on our corporate partners, and false complaints to the authorities marked a bumpy year for our newsroom. We nevertheless battled our way through unscathed, reporting all cases of intimidation to the police and emerging with a strengthened determination to continue our work.\nFor the rest of Hong Kong, 2024 was equally eventful. It saw the passage of a\nnew security law\n, a\nprotest song banned\nand the departure of five\nforeign judges\nfrom the top court, whilst editors from the now-defunct Stand News were\njailed for sedition\n. Meanwhile, 45 democrats were\njailed over a democratic primary\n, the\nJournalist Association chair\nwas fired from the Wall Street Journal, Apple Daily founder\nJimmy Lai took the stand\nin court, and the city recorded the\nhottest year on record\n.\nOur team reported on every beat, with a bumper year for award nominations. HKFP was shortlisted for an International Press Institute\nFree Media Pioneer\naward and a Reporters Without Border\nPress Freedom Prize\n. We also won a\nprize for photography\n, for\ncourage and impact\n, and we were nominated for a prestigious\nSOPA in regional reporting\n.\nHaving previously bolstered our\nEthics Code\nand gained several\ncredibility hallmarks\n, we aim to join the\nJournalism Trust Initiative\nin 2025, as part of our commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness. We will also enrol with\nReporters Shield\nto insure us against any frivolous legal suits.\nThere will also be challenges ahead, as we mark 10 years of HKFP this June. With a HK$1.7m deficit predicted for 2024, we will need to reduce costs and increase our income. We will therefore launch half a dozen new benefits for our valued\nHKFP Patrons\n, in order to safeguard our team and output.\nDespite the bumpy ride, HKFP still has breathing room to report freely on any local, hard news story. We remain\ndedicated to Hong Kong\n, as we are still able to speak to sources on the ground and exercise privileges lost in mainland China: bearing witness in court and at the legislature, and asking tough, direct questions of officials.\nI am happy to present our Annual Report, as we round-up our best coverage, achievements, and accounts from the past 12 months \u2013 all made possible by our monthly donors. The price of a weekly coffee will help us\nkeep the lights on and return to sustainability over the coming year\n. And for those of you who are already HKFP Patrons, thank you for your kind support, and for helping keep independent media alive in Hong Kong.\nAnnual Report 2024:\nOur Mission & Impact\n.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024\n.\nHKFP Awards\n.\nEthics at HKFP\n.\nImpact & Positioning\n.\nStaff & Structure\n.\nTransparency Report 2024\n.\nPress Freedom in 2024\n.\nReader Survey\n.\nHow to Support HKFP\n.\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload the 2024 Annual Report [PDF]\nMission and impact:\nFounded in 2015, Hong Kong Free Press is an impartial, non-profit, award-winning English-language newspaper. Run by journalists, backed by readers and completely independent, HKFP is governed by a public code of ethics.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024:\nOriginal reporting\n: Hong Kong Free Press began 2024 not in its home city, but in Taipei, as voters headed to the polls to elect Taiwan\u2019s next leader. We spoke to\nyoung voters about their concerns\n, and Hongkongers who had moved there in the wake of the 2019 protests and were\ncasting their ballots for the first time\n.\nAhead of Lai-Ching-te\u2019s presidential inauguration, we sat down with Taiwan\u2019s outgoing foreign minister Joseph Wu, pro-Beijing figures, and academics to\ndiscuss the democratic island\u2019s uncertain future\n, and later\nlooked back at the Sunflower Movement\n10 years after students stormed the legislature to protest economic rapprochement with China.\nMost of our reporting, however, remained focused on issues that impacted Hongkongers. Mental health remained a major concern, as we explored the ways that mental health professionals and educators were seeking to\nstem an alarming rise in student suicides\n. When a man suffering from schizophrenia was shot dead by police at his home, his\nfamily told HKFP they could not understand why officers had been so quick to resort to firearms\n.\nIn an effort to gauge public opinion about major political developments \u2013 such as\nthe legislation of a new security law\n,\nDonald Trump\u2019s re-election as US president\n, and the\nopening of an exhibition dedicated to national security\n\u2013 we hit the streets to ask Hongkongers for their opinions.\nWe also spoke to social workers \u2013 whose field was the subject of a major government overhaul \u2013 about the lack of resistance to, or even discussion about, the changes within the sector. The\nsilence was a sign of the times in today\u2019s Hong Kong\n, they said, but uncharacteristic of the historically outspoken industry....",

      "content": "Hong Kong Free Press is proud to have gained the\nTrust Project\nhallmark \u2013 the first global transparency standard that proves a news outlet\u2019s commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness.\nThroughout this year, HKFP has been\npublicly disclosing and expanding its ethical policies, standards, reporting and corrections guidelines\nto adhere to the\neight Trust Indicators\n. The move seeks to improve media literacy and battle \u201cfake news,\u201d misinformation and\u00a0online propaganda.\nFirst adopted in March 2020,\nour newly-revamped guidelines\nlay out HKFP\u2019s mission, our priorities, our expectations for staff conduct and impartiality, as well as how we deal with issues such as AI, advertising, anonymity, balance, security, sourcing and issues of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and identity.\nWe now join around 300 newsrooms across the world displaying the Trust Mark symbol, including the BBC, Washington Post, Sky News, CTV and the Economist.\nWhat is the Trust Project? Click to view.\nThe Trust Project\nis an international consortium of news organisations building standards of transparency and working with technology platforms to affirm and amplify journalism\u2019s commitment to transparency, accuracy, inclusion and fairness so that the public can make informed news choices. It was founded and is led by award-winning journalist\nSally Lehrman.\nWhat are the 8 Trust Indicators?\n1. Best Practices \u2013 who is behind the news?\nIf a journalist\u2019s organization has rules they must follow to make sure their reporting is independent, accurate and honest, then their news will be more trustworthy.\nDoes the site use guidelines to protect honest and independent reporting?\nWhat is the site\u2019s mission and priorities?\nWho funds them?\n2. Journalist Expertise \u2013 who made this?\nWe are rarely there to see events in the news for ourselves, so we rely on the journalist. They should follow strict standards for gathering solid evidence and multiple perspectives.\nAre the journalist(s) credentials easily available?\nDo they have a good professional reputation as a journalist?\nAre they reporting on a topic or community they know well?\n3. Labels \u2013 news, opinion, or what?\nIt\u2019s important to know whether your news is impartial or deliberately biased. Stories should be clearly labelled if they are designed to persuade us to agree. If it\u2019s journalism, then it\u2019s meant to help us develop our\nown\nopinions.\nIs the story impartial or does it have a clear opinion?\nIs it highly partisan, sponsored or advertising something?\nIs the purpose clearly shown?\n4. References \u2013 what are the sources?\nWhen a journalist is developing a news story, they may use information from eye witnesses, documents and other places \u2013 called\nsources\n. When a journalist shows their sources, we can check their reliability for ourselves.\nFor investigative, in-depth or controversial stories, does the journalist provide sources for each claim?\nDo they give details so we can check the sources ourselves?\nDo other sources back up what is being said?\n5. Methods \u2013 why was it built?\nIf we know why a journalist chose a particular story and how they reported it, it\u2019s easier to interpret it. A journalist\u2019s methods help us know how fast-moving, well-researched or impartial the story may be.\nHow much reporting was done?\nWhat methods were used?\nWho else was involved in the process?\n6. Locally sourced \u2013 do they know you and your community?\nIf a journalist knows and lives in the community, they can explain an event or issue more sensitively and accurately. If not, they can improve their reporting by going there and speaking to others who have local and community knowledge.\nWas the reporting done with deep knowledge about the local situation or community?\nWas the journalist on the scene?\nDid the journalist make an effort to listen to members of the community?\n7. Diverse voices \u2013 who is in the news, who is missing?\nIf certain voices or experiences are missing from the news, we don\u2019t get the full picture. Look for voices less commonly heard in society, often because of race, class, generation, gender, sexual orientation, ideology or the region they live in.\nDoes the newsroom commit to bringing in diverse perspectives?\nIs there evidence that the journalist pays attention to diversity?\nAre some communities included only in stereotypical ways, or completely missing?\n8. Actionable feedback \u2013 does this news site listen to me?\nBy inviting and listening to public feedback, journalists can make sure their work is accurate and complete. The public also might help them find important news they had overlooked.\nDoes the news site invite the public to participate?\nDo they ask for feedback?\nDo they correct errors quickly, clearly and prominently?\nHKFP Policies, Ethics Code & Best Practices:\nClick to view our newly-revamped and expanded guidelines:\nAnnual Report\n.\nAwards\n.\nCommunity Guidelines\n.\nFreelance Charter\n.\nFunding\n.\nGuiding Principles\n.\nPlatforms\n.\nSecurity Law\n.\nStaff Roster\n.\nTransparency Report\n....",

      "date": null,
      "content": "As Hong Kong\u2019s most transparent news outlet, HKFP is externally audited annually, sharing all of our accounts online\n. We have no shareholders, and we do not answer to any business tycoon, government, mainland conglomerate or media mogul. HKFP is run by journalists and is a non-profit \u2013 we are answerable only to ourselves and our readers, and\nour newsroom relies on small donations from 1,000 readers\n.\nIn 2024, costs rose following our expansion, whilst income fell amid waning interest in Hong Kong news, a population exodus, and a slowing economy. We invite our readers and supporters to examine our income and spending over the past year, as we look to return to sustainability in 2025.\nCheck out our full Annual Report here\n.\nIncome\nCurrent Revenue Streams\nSpending\nInvesting in People\nPatrons\nSupport HKFP\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload HKFP\u2019s Annual Report [PDF]\nHow is HKFP funded? Income 2016-2024\nOur finalised, externally audited income up to 2023, and our predicted income for 2024 \u2013 in HK$.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Reader supported:\n94% of HKFP\u2019s income comes directly from our readers, ensuring our press freedom and independence.\n\u267b\ufe0f Surplus recycled:\nAs a non-profit, with no shareholders, investors, billionaires or umbrella company overseeing it, any surplus is\nrecycled\nback into the HKFP newsroom for future use.\n\ud83d\udcc9\nCosts reduced\n: In 2024, HKFP slashed costs by switching insurers and merch store suppliers, downgrading software packages, adjusting staff transport allowances, finding sponsors for key costs, and halting most advertising. Given the tough environment for press freedom and the need to retain staff, HKFP vows to safeguard journalist salaries and headcount. Director pay was, however, frozen in 2022.\n\ud83d\udcc8\nNew income streams\n: HKFP launched a newly expanded commercial\nrate card\nin 2024, with over a dozen advertising offerings, as well as photo/video licencing, consultancy, workshop and sponsorship opportunities. We also signed content sales deals with the Copyright Clearance Center and ProRata.ai, and launched new HKFP merch lines to improve cashflow.\n\ud83d\udcb2\n2025 Patrons plan\n: To close the funding gap in 2025, HKFP will provide new benefits to monthly donors.\nCurrent Revenue Streams\nContributions\n: include one-off & monthly Patron contributions by cheque/transfer, cash, PayPal & Stripe credit/debit card (inc. Apple Pay & Google Pay), PayMe, Octopus, CoinDragon, as well as merch sales profit and shopping referral links.\nAds & content sales\n: include ad income from display ads; Apple News & Facebook ads, Google/YouTube ads, directly purchased rate card ads & content sales [from media outlets, institutions and syndication partners LexisNexis, Opera News, ProRata.ai, CCC, Moody\u2019s, NewsBank, ProQuest, Dow Jones Factiva & Nordot etc\u2026]\n\u26a0\ufe0f Record deficit:\nHKFP faced a predicted, record deficit of HK$1.72m in 2024. Although we are able to reinvest our previous surplus, we will need to work on a return to sustainability by further reducing costs and improving income in 2025.\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by\nsupporting our team\n\ud83e\ude99 Bitcoin:\nTo ease the financial situation in 2024, HKFP converted some of its Bitcoin investment into cash in order to pay a month of staff salaries and five months of office rent. 0.69 BTC was withdrawn into HK$506,630 as the exchange rate peaked, leaving 2.16 BTC invested. (Readers donated crypto between 2021-2022. It was declared to Inland Revenue, and retained as an investment, hence it does not appear as 2004 \u201cincome\u201d above. HKFP supports Hong Kong\u2019s moves to become a crypto hub and hopes to accept Bitcoin again soon.)\n\ud83d\udd12 Future security:\nAs of 2021, HKFP has retained a HK$1.5m legal defence fund in light of new challenges to press freedom, in addition to an emergency fund of HK$1m. As HKFP will be joining the\nReporters Shield\nprogramme in 2025 \u2013 which will provide some monetary protection against frivolous lawsuits \u2013 the company\u2019s legal fund will be reduced to HK$1m.\n\ud83d\udca1Efficiency:\nHKFP is run as efficiently and prudently as possible, in order to maximise the impact of our donors\u2019 generosity. We make savings by partnering with other media outlets, using free software/tools, and making full use of teamwork and automation.\n\ud83d\udcdd\nTo view our full audits,\nclick here.\nHKFP Spending 2016-2024\nFinalised expenditure for our latest audited year, 2024, & our predicted 2024 spending \u2013 in HK$.\nInvesting in People\n\ud83d\udcbc Investing in people:\nHKFP competes with international media when it comes to staff pay and conditions. We are proud to set \u2013 or exceed \u2013 industry standards in order to foster talent and retain staff in an increasingly tough environment. 78% of HKFP\u2019s spending goes towards staff remuneration and pensions. When you support HKFP, you can be assured that your contribution is going\ndirectly\ntowards local journalists \u2013 not to shareholders or a profit-making conglomerate.\n\ud83d\udcb5 Living Wage Employer:\nIn 2024, HKFP gained the Oxfam Living Wage Employer certification.\n\u2714\ufe0f\nStaff benefits include\n: \u2713 ...",

As part of our public service mission, HKFP commissioned a bilingual, copyright-friendly children\u2019s book to help youngsters in Hong Kong \u2013 and beyond \u2013 understand what is happening.\nBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\nwas illustrated by\nKitty N. Wong\n, written by Kitty and Daniel Levia, and includes a foreword by\nFull Cup Therapy\u2019s\nRachel Winston.\nDownload the book:\nLetter to parents \u2013\nclick to view\nWhen going through difficult times, parents often wonder and worry, \u201cWhat will be the impact of this on my child? How can I stop them from being traumatised?\u201d\nKitty N. Wong sought to produce a simple child friendly book to help reduce the traumatic impact of the recent pandemic upon children. Together with the experienced teacher and author Daniel Levia, we set out to make this happen.\nWhile the personal impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will vary, there is a common thread we are all experiencing; uncertainty. When we feel uncertain for prolonged periods of time it can set off feelings of fear and helplessness. It is hard for us to stay grounded but if we are lucky we may have learnt our own strategies for coping from the past that we can now draw upon. With limited life experience, and brains that are still developing, children depend upon us (their network of safe people) to lean upon. You are your child\u2019s most important resource!\nTwo very useful strategies for building your child\u2019s resilience are storytelling and fostering personal connection. Stories help children to make sense of their experiences and help them to recognise their own feelings, as well as the feelings of others. Feeling connected to our significant others is so important for regulating big emotions and having space to problem solve challenges in our daily lives. Snuggling up with your child to read this book ticks both of these resilience building boxes!\n\u201cBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\u201d is a heartfelt, hopeful and empowering story set in Asia. Bobby\u2019s story aims to help your child make sense of the pandemic and of the many feelings that may have come up as a result.\nBobby goes on an educational journey with Owl, releases his feelings and comes into a more empowered position. With the use of the reminder phrase PASS (Paws, Arms, Snouts & Spirits) helping your child to feel more empowered too.\nLastly, Owl holds a hopeful picture of the future while acknowledging the current challenges and difficult emotions. May we all try to embody this wise owl and hold the space for our children\u2019s emotions (however imperfectly). Of course this is not always possible and we too as adults need to seek out our own support systems at those times.\nBobby\u2019s story is an inspirational tale of how he was able to turn around his feelings of despair into hope. Through connection and with support he innovates new ways to play with and feel closer to his friends.\nWe hope that this book provides an opportunity for emotional connection for your child, as well as acting as a springboard for you as parents to have meaningful and productive conversations about this health crisis.\nRachel Winston\nRegistered Play & Creative Arts Therapist in Hong Kong\nfullcupplaytherapy.com\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English [PDF]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese [PDF]\nDownload\nDownload accompanying worksheets:\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Chinese worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nAdapt & translate:\nThe digital book is shared under a\nCC-BY-NC-SA: Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike (2020)\nCreative Commons license\n\u2013 it lets others remix, adapt, translate and build upon the book non-commercially, as long as new creations include full credits and the identical licence.\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nIf you have translated \u201cBobby\u201d into another language,\nplease get in touch\n, so we can share you work!\nVideo:\nTeam:\nKitty N.

      "content": "Dear readers and supporters,\nIdeas that HKFP could avoid some of the pressures faced by the rest of Hong Kong\u2019s independent media sector were dashed in 2024. Threats and harassment, official scrutiny from multiple government departments, pressure on our corporate partners, and false complaints to the authorities marked a bumpy year for our newsroom. We nevertheless battled our way through unscathed, reporting all cases of intimidation to the police and emerging with a strengthened determination to continue our work.\nFor the rest of Hong Kong, 2024 was equally eventful. It saw the passage of a\nnew security law\n, a\nprotest song banned\nand the departure of five\nforeign judges\nfrom the top court, whilst editors from the now-defunct Stand News were\njailed for sedition\n. Meanwhile, 45 democrats were\njailed over a democratic primary\n, the\nJournalist Association chair\nwas fired from the Wall Street Journal, Apple Daily founder\nJimmy Lai took the stand\nin court, and the city recorded the\nhottest year on record\n.\nOur team reported on every beat, with a bumper year for award nominations. HKFP was shortlisted for an International Press Institute\nFree Media Pioneer\naward and a Reporters Without Border\nPress Freedom Prize\n. We also won a\nprize for photography\n, for\ncourage and impact\n, and we were nominated for a prestigious\nSOPA in regional reporting\n.\nHaving previously bolstered our\nEthics Code\nand gained several\ncredibility hallmarks\n, we aim to join the\nJournalism Trust Initiative\nin 2025, as part of our commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness. We will also enrol with\nReporters Shield\nto insure us against any frivolous legal suits.\nThere will also be challenges ahead, as we mark 10 years of HKFP this June. With a HK$1.7m deficit predicted for 2024, we will need to reduce costs and increase our income. We will therefore launch half a dozen new benefits for our valued\nHKFP Patrons\n, in order to safeguard our team and output.\nDespite the bumpy ride, HKFP still has breathing room to report freely on any local, hard news story. We remain\ndedicated to Hong Kong\n, as we are still able to speak to sources on the ground and exercise privileges lost in mainland China: bearing witness in court and at the legislature, and asking tough, direct questions of officials.\nI am happy to present our Annual Report, as we round-up our best coverage, achievements, and accounts from the past 12 months \u2013 all made possible by our monthly donors. The price of a weekly coffee will help us\nkeep the lights on and return to sustainability over the coming year\n. And for those of you who are already HKFP Patrons, thank you for your kind support, and for helping keep independent media alive in Hong Kong.\nAnnual Report 2024:\nOur Mission & Impact\n.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024\n.\nHKFP Awards\n.\nEthics at HKFP\n.\nImpact & Positioning\n.\nStaff & Structure\n.\nTransparency Report 2024\n.\nPress Freedom in 2024\n.\nReader Survey\n.\nHow to Support HKFP\n.\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload the 2024 Annual Report [PDF]\nMission and impact:\nFounded in 2015, Hong Kong Free Press is an impartial, non-profit, award-winning English-language newspaper. Run by journalists, backed by readers and completely independent, HKFP is governed by a public code of ethics.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024:\nOriginal reporting\n: Hong Kong Free Press began 2024 not in its home city, but in Taipei, as voters headed to the polls to elect Taiwan\u2019s next leader. We spoke to\nyoung voters about their concerns\n, and Hongkongers who had moved there in the wake of the 2019 protests and were\ncasting their ballots for the first time\n.\nAhead of Lai-Ching-te\u2019s presidential inauguration, we sat down with Taiwan\u2019s outgoing foreign minister Joseph Wu, pro-Beijing figures, and academics to\ndiscuss the democratic island\u2019s uncertain future\n, and later\nlooked back at the Sunflower Movement\n10 years after students stormed the legislature to protest economic rapprochement with China.\nMost of our reporting, however, remained focused on issues that impacted Hongkongers. Mental health remained a major concern, as we explored the ways that mental health professionals and educators were seeking to\nstem an alarming rise in student suicides\n. When a man suffering from schizophrenia was shot dead by police at his home, his\nfamily told HKFP they could not understand why officers had been so quick to resort to firearms\n.\nIn an effort to gauge public opinion about major political developments \u2013 such as\nthe legislation of a new security law\n,\nDonald Trump\u2019s re-election as US president\n, and the\nopening of an exhibition dedicated to national security\n\u2013 we hit the streets to ask Hongkongers for their opinions.\nWe also spoke to social workers \u2013 whose field was the subject of a major government overhaul \u2013 about the lack of resistance to, or even discussion about, the changes within the sector. The\nsilence was a sign of the times in today\u2019s Hong Kong\n, they said, but uncharacteristic of the historically outspoken industry....",

      "content": "Hong Kong Free Press is proud to have gained the\nTrust Project\nhallmark \u2013 the first global transparency standard that proves a news outlet\u2019s commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness.\nThroughout this year, HKFP has been\npublicly disclosing and expanding its ethical policies, standards, reporting and corrections guidelines\nto adhere to the\neight Trust Indicators\n. The move seeks to improve media literacy and battle \u201cfake news,\u201d misinformation and\u00a0online propaganda.\nFirst adopted in March 2020,\nour newly-revamped guidelines\nlay out HKFP\u2019s mission, our priorities, our expectations for staff conduct and impartiality, as well as how we deal with issues such as AI, advertising, anonymity, balance, security, sourcing and issues of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and identity.\nWe now join around 300 newsrooms across the world displaying the Trust Mark symbol, including the BBC, Washington Post, Sky News, CTV and the Economist.\nWhat is the Trust Project? Click to view.\nThe Trust Project\nis an international consortium of news organisations building standards of transparency and working with technology platforms to affirm and amplify journalism\u2019s commitment to transparency, accuracy, inclusion and fairness so that the public can make informed news choices. It was founded and is led by award-winning journalist\nSally Lehrman.\nWhat are the 8 Trust Indicators?\n1. Best Practices \u2013 who is behind the news?\nIf a journalist\u2019s organization has rules they must follow to make sure their reporting is independent, accurate and honest, then their news will be more trustworthy.\nDoes the site use guidelines to protect honest and independent reporting?\nWhat is the site\u2019s mission and priorities?\nWho funds them?\n2. Journalist Expertise \u2013 who made this?\nWe are rarely there to see events in the news for ourselves, so we rely on the journalist. They should follow strict standards for gathering solid evidence and multiple perspectives.\nAre the journalist(s) credentials easily available?\nDo they have a good professional reputation as a journalist?\nAre they reporting on a topic or community they know well?\n3. Labels \u2013 news, opinion, or what?\nIt\u2019s important to know whether your news is impartial or deliberately biased. Stories should be clearly labelled if they are designed to persuade us to agree. If it\u2019s journalism, then it\u2019s meant to help us develop our\nown\nopinions.\nIs the story impartial or does it have a clear opinion?\nIs it highly partisan, sponsored or advertising something?\nIs the purpose clearly shown?\n4. References \u2013 what are the sources?\nWhen a journalist is developing a news story, they may use information from eye witnesses, documents and other places \u2013 called\nsources\n. When a journalist shows their sources, we can check their reliability for ourselves.\nFor investigative, in-depth or controversial stories, does the journalist provide sources for each claim?\nDo they give details so we can check the sources ourselves?\nDo other sources back up what is being said?\n5. Methods \u2013 why was it built?\nIf we know why a journalist chose a particular story and how they reported it, it\u2019s easier to interpret it. A journalist\u2019s methods help us know how fast-moving, well-researched or impartial the story may be.\nHow much reporting was done?\nWhat methods were used?\nWho else was involved in the process?\n6. Locally sourced \u2013 do they know you and your community?\nIf a journalist knows and lives in the community, they can explain an event or issue more sensitively and accurately. If not, they can improve their reporting by going there and speaking to others who have local and community knowledge.\nWas the reporting done with deep knowledge about the local situation or community?\nWas the journalist on the scene?\nDid the journalist make an effort to listen to members of the community?\n7. Diverse voices \u2013 who is in the news, who is missing?\nIf certain voices or experiences are missing from the news, we don\u2019t get the full picture. Look for voices less commonly heard in society, often because of race, class, generation, gender, sexual orientation, ideology or the region they live in.\nDoes the newsroom commit to bringing in diverse perspectives?\nIs there evidence that the journalist pays attention to diversity?\nAre some communities included only in stereotypical ways, or completely missing?\n8. Actionable feedback \u2013 does this news site listen to me?\nBy inviting and listening to public feedback, journalists can make sure their work is accurate and complete. The public also might help them find important news they had overlooked.\nDoes the news site invite the public to participate?\nDo they ask for feedback?\nDo they correct errors quickly, clearly and prominently?\nHKFP Policies, Ethics Code & Best Practices:\nClick to view our newly-revamped and expanded guidelines:\nAnnual Report\n.\nAwards\n.\nCommunity Guidelines\n.\nFreelance Charter\n.\nFunding\n.\nGuiding Principles\n.\nPlatforms\n.\nSecurity Law\n.\nStaff Roster\n.\nTransparency Report\n....",

      "content": "As Hong Kong\u2019s most transparent news outlet, HKFP is externally audited annually, sharing all of our accounts online\n. We have no shareholders, and we do not answer to any business tycoon, government, mainland conglomerate or media mogul. HKFP is run by journalists and is a non-profit \u2013 we are answerable only to ourselves and our readers, and\nour newsroom relies on small donations from 1,000 readers\n.\nIn 2024, costs rose following our expansion, whilst income fell amid waning interest in Hong Kong news, a population exodus, and a slowing economy. We invite our readers and supporters to examine our income and spending over the past year, as we look to return to sustainability in 2025.\nCheck out our full Annual Report here\n.\nIncome\nCurrent Revenue Streams\nSpending\nInvesting in People\nPatrons\nSupport HKFP\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload HKFP\u2019s Annual Report [PDF]\nHow is HKFP funded? Income 2016-2024\nOur finalised, externally audited income up to 2023, and our predicted income for 2024 \u2013 in HK$.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Reader supported:\n94% of HKFP\u2019s income comes directly from our readers, ensuring our press freedom and independence.\n\u267b\ufe0f Surplus recycled:\nAs a non-profit, with no shareholders, investors, billionaires or umbrella company overseeing it, any surplus is\nrecycled\nback into the HKFP newsroom for future use.\n\ud83d\udcc9\nCosts reduced\n: In 2024, HKFP slashed costs by switching insurers and merch store suppliers, downgrading software packages, adjusting staff transport allowances, finding sponsors for key costs, and halting most advertising. Given the tough environment for press freedom and the need to retain staff, HKFP vows to safeguard journalist salaries and headcount. Director pay was, however, frozen in 2022.\n\ud83d\udcc8\nNew income streams\n: HKFP launched a newly expanded commercial\nrate card\nin 2024, with over a dozen advertising offerings, as well as photo/video licencing, consultancy, workshop and sponsorship opportunities. We also signed content sales deals with the Copyright Clearance Center and ProRata.ai, and launched new HKFP merch lines to improve cashflow.\n\ud83d\udcb2\n2025 Patrons plan\n: To close the funding gap in 2025, HKFP will provide new benefits to monthly donors.\nCurrent Revenue Streams\nContributions\n: include one-off & monthly Patron contributions by cheque/transfer, cash, PayPal & Stripe credit/debit card (inc. Apple Pay & Google Pay), PayMe, Octopus, CoinDragon, as well as merch sales profit and shopping referral links.\nAds & content sales\n: include ad income from display ads; Apple News & Facebook ads, Google/YouTube ads, directly purchased rate card ads & content sales [from media outlets, institutions and syndication partners LexisNexis, Opera News, ProRata.ai, CCC, Moody\u2019s, NewsBank, ProQuest, Dow Jones Factiva & Nordot etc\u2026]\n\u26a0\ufe0f Record deficit:\nHKFP faced a predicted, record deficit of HK$1.72m in 2024. Although we are able to reinvest our previous surplus, we will need to work on a return to sustainability by further reducing costs and improving income in 2025.\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by\nsupporting our team\n\ud83e\ude99 Bitcoin:\nTo ease the financial situation in 2024, HKFP converted some of its Bitcoin investment into cash in order to pay a month of staff salaries and five months of office rent. 0.69 BTC was withdrawn into HK$506,630 as the exchange rate peaked, leaving 2.16 BTC invested. (Readers donated crypto between 2021-2022. It was declared to Inland Revenue, and retained as an investment, hence it does not appear as 2004 \u201cincome\u201d above. HKFP supports Hong Kong\u2019s moves to become a crypto hub and hopes to accept Bitcoin again soon.)\n\ud83d\udd12 Future security:\nAs of 2021, HKFP has retained a HK$1.5m legal defence fund in light of new challenges to press freedom, in addition to an emergency fund of HK$1m. As HKFP will be joining the\nReporters Shield\nprogramme in 2025 \u2013 which will provide some monetary protection against frivolous lawsuits \u2013 the company\u2019s legal fund will be reduced to HK$1m.\n\ud83d\udca1Efficiency:\nHKFP is run as efficiently and prudently as possible, in order to maximise the impact of our donors\u2019 generosity. We make savings by partnering with other media outlets, using free software/tools, and making full use of teamwork and automation.\n\ud83d\udcdd\nTo view our full audits,\nclick here.\nHKFP Spending 2016-2024\nFinalised expenditure for our latest audited year, 2024, & our predicted 2024 spending \u2013 in HK$.\nInvesting in People\n\ud83d\udcbc Investing in people:\nHKFP competes with international media when it comes to staff pay and conditions. We are proud to set \u2013 or exceed \u2013 industry standards in order to foster talent and retain staff in an increasingly tough environment. 78% of HKFP\u2019s spending goes towards staff remuneration and pensions. When you support HKFP, you can be assured that your contribution is going\ndirectly\ntowards local journalists \u2013 not to shareholders or a profit-making conglomerate.\n\ud83d\udcb5 Living Wage Employer:\nIn 2024, HKFP gained the Oxfam Living Wage Employer certification.\n\u2714\ufe0f\nStaff benefits include\n: \u2713 ...",

      "content": "2020 has been a traumatic and confusing year for the best of us, but the lasting impact of\nthe Covid-19 pandemic\non children is easily overlooked. As part of our public service mission, HKFP commissioned a bilingual, copyright-friendly children\u2019s book to help youngsters in Hong Kong \u2013 and beyond \u2013 understand what is happening.\nBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\nwas illustrated by\nKitty N. Wong\n, written by Kitty and Daniel Levia, and includes a foreword by\nFull Cup Therapy\u2019s\nRachel Winston.\nDownload the book:\nLetter to parents \u2013\nclick to view\nWhen going through difficult times, parents often wonder and worry, \u201cWhat will be the impact of this on my child? How can I stop them from being traumatised?\u201d\nKitty N. Wong sought to produce a simple child friendly book to help reduce the traumatic impact of the recent pandemic upon children. Together with the experienced teacher and author Daniel Levia, we set out to make this happen.\nWhile the personal impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will vary, there is a common thread we are all experiencing; uncertainty. When we feel uncertain for prolonged periods of time it can set off feelings of fear and helplessness. It is hard for us to stay grounded but if we are lucky we may have learnt our own strategies for coping from the past that we can now draw upon. With limited life experience, and brains that are still developing, children depend upon us (their network of safe people) to lean upon. You are your child\u2019s most important resource!\nTwo very useful strategies for building your child\u2019s resilience are storytelling and fostering personal connection. Stories help children to make sense of their experiences and help them to recognise their own feelings, as well as the feelings of others. Feeling connected to our significant others is so important for regulating big emotions and having space to problem solve challenges in our daily lives. Snuggling up with your child to read this book ticks both of these resilience building boxes!\n\u201cBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\u201d is a heartfelt, hopeful and empowering story set in Asia. Bobby\u2019s story aims to help your child make sense of the pandemic and of the many feelings that may have come up as a result.\nBobby goes on an educational journey with Owl, releases his feelings and comes into a more empowered position. With the use of the reminder phrase PASS (Paws, Arms, Snouts & Spirits) helping your child to feel more empowered too.\nLastly, Owl holds a hopeful picture of the future while acknowledging the current challenges and difficult emotions. May we all try to embody this wise owl and hold the space for our children\u2019s emotions (however imperfectly). Of course this is not always possible and we too as adults need to seek out our own support systems at those times.\nBobby\u2019s story is an inspirational tale of how he was able to turn around his feelings of despair into hope. Through connection and with support he innovates new ways to play with and feel closer to his friends.\nWe hope that this book provides an opportunity for emotional connection for your child, as well as acting as a springboard for you as parents to have meaningful and productive conversations about this health crisis.\nRachel Winston\nRegistered Play & Creative Arts Therapist in Hong Kong\nfullcupplaytherapy.com\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English [PDF]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese [PDF]\nDownload\nDownload accompanying worksheets:\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Chinese worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nAdapt & translate:\nThe digital book is shared under a\nCC-BY-NC-SA: Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike (2020)\nCreative Commons license\n\u2013 it lets others remix, adapt, translate and build upon the book non-commercially, as long as new creations include full credits and the identical licence.\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nIf you have translated \u201cBobby\u201d into another language,\nplease get in touch\n, so we can share you work!\nVideo:\nTeam:\nKitty N.

      "content": "Dear readers and supporters,\nIdeas that HKFP could avoid some of the pressures faced by the rest of Hong Kong\u2019s independent media sector were dashed in 2024. Threats and harassment, official scrutiny from multiple government departments, pressure on our corporate partners, and false complaints to the authorities marked a bumpy year for our newsroom. We nevertheless battled our way through unscathed, reporting all cases of intimidation to the police and emerging with a strengthened determination to continue our work.\nFor the rest of Hong Kong, 2024 was equally eventful. It saw the passage of a\nnew security law\n, a\nprotest song banned\nand the departure of five\nforeign judges\nfrom the top court, whilst editors from the now-defunct Stand News were\njailed for sedition\n. Meanwhile, 45 democrats were\njailed over a democratic primary\n, the\nJournalist Association chair\nwas fired from the Wall Street Journal, Apple Daily founder\nJimmy Lai took the stand\nin court, and the city recorded the\nhottest year on record\n.\nOur team reported on every beat, with a bumper year for award nominations. HKFP was shortlisted for an International Press Institute\nFree Media Pioneer\naward and a Reporters Without Border\nPress Freedom Prize\n. We also won a\nprize for photography\n, for\ncourage and impact\n, and we were nominated for a prestigious\nSOPA in regional reporting\n.\nHaving previously bolstered our\nEthics Code\nand gained several\ncredibility hallmarks\n, we aim to join the\nJournalism Trust Initiative\nin 2025, as part of our commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness. We will also enrol with\nReporters Shield\nto insure us against any frivolous legal suits.\nThere will also be challenges ahead, as we mark 10 years of HKFP this June. With a HK$1.7m deficit predicted for 2024, we will need to reduce costs and increase our income. We will therefore launch half a dozen new benefits for our valued\nHKFP Patrons\n, in order to safeguard our team and output.\nDespite the bumpy ride, HKFP still has breathing room to report freely on any local, hard news story. We remain\ndedicated to Hong Kong\n, as we are still able to speak to sources on the ground and exercise privileges lost in mainland China: bearing witness in court and at the legislature, and asking tough, direct questions of officials.\nI am happy to present our Annual Report, as we round-up our best coverage, achievements, and accounts from the past 12 months \u2013 all made possible by our monthly donors. The price of a weekly coffee will help us\nkeep the lights on and return to sustainability over the coming year\n. And for those of you who are already HKFP Patrons, thank you for your kind support, and for helping keep independent media alive in Hong Kong.\nAnnual Report 2024:\nOur Mission & Impact\n.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024\n.\nHKFP Awards\n.\nEthics at HKFP\n.\nImpact & Positioning\n.\nStaff & Structure\n.\nTransparency Report 2024\n.\nPress Freedom in 2024\n.\nReader Survey\n.\nHow to Support HKFP\n.\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload the 2024 Annual Report [PDF]\nMission and impact:\nFounded in 2015, Hong Kong Free Press is an impartial, non-profit, award-winning English-language newspaper. Run by journalists, backed by readers and completely independent, HKFP is governed by a public code of ethics.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024:\nOriginal reporting\n: Hong Kong Free Press began 2024 not in its home city, but in Taipei, as voters headed to the polls to elect Taiwan\u2019s next leader. We spoke to\nyoung voters about their concerns\n, and Hongkongers who had moved there in the wake of the 2019 protests and were\ncasting their ballots for the first time\n.\nAhead of Lai-Ching-te\u2019s presidential inauguration, we sat down with Taiwan\u2019s outgoing foreign minister Joseph Wu, pro-Beijing figures, and academics to\ndiscuss the democratic island\u2019s uncertain future\n, and later\nlooked back at the Sunflower Movement\n10 years after students stormed the legislature to protest economic rapprochement with China.\nMost of our reporting, however, remained focused on issues that impacted Hongkongers. Mental health remained a major concern, as we explored the ways that mental health professionals and educators were seeking to\nstem an alarming rise in student suicides\n. When a man suffering from schizophrenia was shot dead by police at his home, his\nfamily told HKFP they could not understand why officers had been so quick to resort to firearms\n.\nIn an effort to gauge public opinion about major political developments \u2013 such as\nthe legislation of a new security law\n,\nDonald Trump\u2019s re-election as US president\n, and the\nopening of an exhibition dedicated to national security\n\u2013 we hit the streets to ask Hongkongers for their opinions.\nWe also spoke to social workers \u2013 whose field was the subject of a major government overhaul \u2013 about the lack of resistance to, or even discussion about, the changes within the sector. The\nsilence was a sign of the times in today\u2019s Hong Kong\n, they said, but uncharacteristic of the historically outspoken industry....",

It was founded and is led by award-winning journalist\nSally Lehrman.\nWhat are the 8 Trust Indicators?\n1. Best Practices \u2013 who is behind the news?\nIf a journalist\u2019s organization has rules they must follow to make sure their reporting is independent, accurate and honest, then their news will be more trustworthy.\nDoes the site use guidelines to protect honest and independent reporting?\nWhat is the site\u2019s mission and priorities?\nWho funds them?\n2. Journalist Expertise \u2013 who made this?\nWe are rarely there to see events in the news for ourselves, so we rely on the journalist. They should follow strict standards for gathering solid evidence and multiple perspectives.\nAre the journalist(s) credentials easily available?\nDo they have a good professional reputation as a journalist?\nAre they reporting on a topic or community they know well?\n3. Labels \u2013 news, opinion, or what?\nIt\u2019s important to know whether your news is impartial or deliberately biased. Stories should be clearly labelled if they are designed to persuade us to agree. If it\u2019s journalism, then it\u2019s meant to help us develop our\nown\nopinions.\nIs the story impartial or does it have a clear opinion?\nIs it highly partisan, sponsored or advertising something?\nIs the purpose clearly shown?\n4. References \u2013 what are the sources?\nWhen a journalist is developing a news story, they may use information from eye witnesses, documents and other places \u2013 called\nsources\n. When a journalist shows their sources, we can check their reliability for ourselves.\nFor investigative, in-depth or controversial stories, does the journalist provide sources for each claim?\nDo they give details so we can check the sources ourselves?\nDo other sources back up what is being said?\n5. Methods \u2013 why was it built?\nIf we know why a journalist chose a particular story and how they reported it, it\u2019s easier to interpret it. A journalist\u2019s methods help us know how fast-moving, well-researched or impartial the story may be.\nHow much reporting was done?\nWhat methods were used?\nWho else was involved in the process?\n6. Locally sourced \u2013 do they know you and your community?\nIf a journalist knows and lives in the community, they can explain an event or issue more sensitively and accurately. If not, they can improve their reporting by going there and speaking to others who have local and community knowledge.\nWas the reporting done with deep knowledge about the local situation or community?\nWas the journalist on the scene?\nDid the journalist make an effort to listen to members of the community?\n7. Diverse voices \u2013 who is in the news, who is missing?\nIf certain voices or experiences are missing from the news, we don\u2019t get the full picture. Look for voices less commonly heard in society, often because of race, class, generation, gender, sexual orientation, ideology or the region they live in.\nDoes the newsroom commit to bringing in diverse perspectives?\nIs there evidence that the journalist pays attention to diversity?\nAre some communities included only in stereotypical ways, or completely missing?\n8. Actionable feedback \u2013 does this news site listen to me?\nBy inviting and listening to public feedback, journalists can make sure their work is accurate and complete. The public also might help them find important news they had overlooked.\nDoes the news site invite the public to participate?\nDo they ask for feedback?\nDo they correct errors quickly, clearly and prominently?\nHKFP Policies, Ethics Code & Best Practices:\nClick to view our newly-revamped and expanded guidelines:\nAnnual Report\n.\nAwards\n.\nCommunity Guidelines\n.\nFreelance Charter\n.\nFunding\n.\nGuiding Principles\n.\nPlatforms\n.\nSecurity Law\n.\nStaff Roster\n.\nTransparency Report\n....",

      "date": null,
      "content": "As Hong Kong\u2019s most transparent news outlet, HKFP is externally audited annually, sharing all of our accounts online\n. We have no shareholders, and we do not answer to any business tycoon, government, mainland conglomerate or media mogul. HKFP is run by journalists and is a non-profit \u2013 we are answerable only to ourselves and our readers, and\nour newsroom relies on small donations from 1,000 readers\n.\nIn 2024, costs rose following our expansion, whilst income fell amid waning interest in Hong Kong news, a population exodus, and a slowing economy. We invite our readers and supporters to examine our income and spending over the past year, as we look to return to sustainability in 2025.\nCheck out our full Annual Report here\n.\nIncome\nCurrent Revenue Streams\nSpending\nInvesting in People\nPatrons\nSupport HKFP\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload HKFP\u2019s Annual Report [PDF]\nHow is HKFP funded? Income 2016-2024\nOur finalised, externally audited income up to 2023, and our predicted income for 2024 \u2013 in HK$.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Reader supported:\n94% of HKFP\u2019s income comes directly from our readers, ensuring our press freedom and independence.\n\u267b\ufe0f Surplus recycled:\nAs a non-profit, with no shareholders, investors, billionaires or umbrella company overseeing it, any surplus is\nrecycled\nback into the HKFP newsroom for future use.\n\ud83d\udcc9\nCosts reduced\n: In 2024, HKFP slashed costs by switching insurers and merch store suppliers, downgrading software packages, adjusting staff transport allowances, finding sponsors for key costs, and halting most advertising. Given the tough environment for press freedom and the need to retain staff, HKFP vows to safeguard journalist salaries and headcount. Director pay was, however, frozen in 2022.\n\ud83d\udcc8\nNew income streams\n: HKFP launched a newly expanded commercial\nrate card\nin 2024, with over a dozen advertising offerings, as well as photo/video licencing, consultancy, workshop and sponsorship opportunities. We also signed content sales deals with the Copyright Clearance Center and ProRata.ai, and launched new HKFP merch lines to improve cashflow.\n\ud83d\udcb2\n2025 Patrons plan\n: To close the funding gap in 2025, HKFP will provide new benefits to monthly donors.\nCurrent Revenue Streams\nContributions\n: include one-off & monthly Patron contributions by cheque/transfer, cash, PayPal & Stripe credit/debit card (inc. Apple Pay & Google Pay), PayMe, Octopus, CoinDragon, as well as merch sales profit and shopping referral links.\nAds & content sales\n: include ad income from display ads; Apple News & Facebook ads, Google/YouTube ads, directly purchased rate card ads & content sales [from media outlets, institutions and syndication partners LexisNexis, Opera News, ProRata.ai, CCC, Moody\u2019s, NewsBank, ProQuest, Dow Jones Factiva & Nordot etc\u2026]\n\u26a0\ufe0f Record deficit:\nHKFP faced a predicted, record deficit of HK$1.72m in 2024. Although we are able to reinvest our previous surplus, we will need to work on a return to sustainability by further reducing costs and improving income in 2025.\nHelp safeguard press freedom & keep HKFP free for all readers by\nsupporting our team\n\ud83e\ude99 Bitcoin:\nTo ease the financial situation in 2024, HKFP converted some of its Bitcoin investment into cash in order to pay a month of staff salaries and five months of office rent. 0.69 BTC was withdrawn into HK$506,630 as the exchange rate peaked, leaving 2.16 BTC invested. (Readers donated crypto between 2021-2022. It was declared to Inland Revenue, and retained as an investment, hence it does not appear as 2004 \u201cincome\u201d above. HKFP supports Hong Kong\u2019s moves to become a crypto hub and hopes to accept Bitcoin again soon.)\n\ud83d\udd12 Future security:\nAs of 2021, HKFP has retained a HK$1.5m legal defence fund in light of new challenges to press freedom, in addition to an emergency fund of HK$1m. As HKFP will be joining the\nReporters Shield\nprogramme in 2025 \u2013 which will provide some monetary protection against frivolous lawsuits \u2013 the company\u2019s legal fund will be reduced to HK$1m.\n\ud83d\udca1Efficiency:\nHKFP is run as efficiently and prudently as possible, in order to maximise the impact of our donors\u2019 generosity. We make savings by partnering with other media outlets, using free software/tools, and making full use of teamwork and automation.\n\ud83d\udcdd\nTo view our full audits,\nclick here.\nHKFP Spending 2016-2024\nFinalised expenditure for our latest audited year, 2024, & our predicted 2024 spending \u2013 in HK$.\nInvesting in People\n\ud83d\udcbc Investing in people:\nHKFP competes with international media when it comes to staff pay and conditions. We are proud to set \u2013 or exceed \u2013 industry standards in order to foster talent and retain staff in an increasingly tough environment. 78% of HKFP\u2019s spending goes towards staff remuneration and pensions. When you support HKFP, you can be assured that your contribution is going\ndirectly\ntowards local journalists \u2013 not to shareholders or a profit-making conglomerate.\n\ud83d\udcb5 Living Wage Employer:\nIn 2024, HKFP gained the Oxfam Living Wage Employer certification.\n\u2714\ufe0f\nStaff benefits include\n: \u2713 ...",

      "content": "2020 has been a traumatic and confusing year for the best of us, but the lasting impact of\nthe Covid-19 pandemic\non children is easily overlooked. As part of our public service mission, HKFP commissioned a bilingual, copyright-friendly children\u2019s book to help youngsters in Hong Kong \u2013 and beyond \u2013 understand what is happening.\nBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\nwas illustrated by\nKitty N. Wong\n, written by Kitty and Daniel Levia, and includes a foreword by\nFull Cup Therapy\u2019s\nRachel Winston.\nDownload the book:\nLetter to parents \u2013\nclick to view\nWhen going through difficult times, parents often wonder and worry, \u201cWhat will be the impact of this on my child? How can I stop them from being traumatised?\u201d\nKitty N. Wong sought to produce a simple child friendly book to help reduce the traumatic impact of the recent pandemic upon children. Together with the experienced teacher and author Daniel Levia, we set out to make this happen.\nWhile the personal impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will vary, there is a common thread we are all experiencing; uncertainty. When we feel uncertain for prolonged periods of time it can set off feelings of fear and helplessness. It is hard for us to stay grounded but if we are lucky we may have learnt our own strategies for coping from the past that we can now draw upon. With limited life experience, and brains that are still developing, children depend upon us (their network of safe people) to lean upon. You are your child\u2019s most important resource!\nTwo very useful strategies for building your child\u2019s resilience are storytelling and fostering personal connection. Stories help children to make sense of their experiences and help them to recognise their own feelings, as well as the feelings of others. Feeling connected to our significant others is so important for regulating big emotions and having space to problem solve challenges in our daily lives. Snuggling up with your child to read this book ticks both of these resilience building boxes!\n\u201cBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\u201d is a heartfelt, hopeful and empowering story set in Asia. Bobby\u2019s story aims to help your child make sense of the pandemic and of the many feelings that may have come up as a result.\nBobby goes on an educational journey with Owl, releases his feelings and comes into a more empowered position. With the use of the reminder phrase PASS (Paws, Arms, Snouts & Spirits) helping your child to feel more empowered too.\nLastly, Owl holds a hopeful picture of the future while acknowledging the current challenges and difficult emotions. May we all try to embody this wise owl and hold the space for our children\u2019s emotions (however imperfectly). Of course this is not always possible and we too as adults need to seek out our own support systems at those times.\nBobby\u2019s story is an inspirational tale of how he was able to turn around his feelings of despair into hope. Through connection and with support he innovates new ways to play with and feel closer to his friends.\nWe hope that this book provides an opportunity for emotional connection for your child, as well as acting as a springboard for you as parents to have meaningful and productive conversations about this health crisis.\nRachel Winston\nRegistered Play & Creative Arts Therapist in Hong Kong\nfullcupplaytherapy.com\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English [PDF]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese [PDF]\nDownload\nDownload accompanying worksheets:\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Chinese worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nAdapt & translate:\nThe digital book is shared under a\nCC-BY-NC-SA: Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike (2020)\nCreative Commons license\n\u2013 it lets others remix, adapt, translate and build upon the book non-commercially, as long as new creations include full credits and the identical licence.\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nIf you have translated \u201cBobby\u201d into another language,\nplease get in touch\n, so we can share you work!\nVideo:\nTeam:\nKitty N.

      "content": "Dear readers and supporters,\nIdeas that HKFP could avoid some of the pressures faced by the rest of Hong Kong\u2019s independent media sector were dashed in 2024. Threats and harassment, official scrutiny from multiple government departments, pressure on our corporate partners, and false complaints to the authorities marked a bumpy year for our newsroom. We nevertheless battled our way through unscathed, reporting all cases of intimidation to the police and emerging with a strengthened determination to continue our work.\nFor the rest of Hong Kong, 2024 was equally eventful. It saw the passage of a\nnew security law\n, a\nprotest song banned\nand the departure of five\nforeign judges\nfrom the top court, whilst editors from the now-defunct Stand News were\njailed for sedition\n. Meanwhile, 45 democrats were\njailed over a democratic primary\n, the\nJournalist Association chair\nwas fired from the Wall Street Journal, Apple Daily founder\nJimmy Lai took the stand\nin court, and the city recorded the\nhottest year on record\n.\nOur team reported on every beat, with a bumper year for award nominations. HKFP was shortlisted for an International Press Institute\nFree Media Pioneer\naward and a Reporters Without Border\nPress Freedom Prize\n. We also won a\nprize for photography\n, for\ncourage and impact\n, and we were nominated for a prestigious\nSOPA in regional reporting\n.\nHaving previously bolstered our\nEthics Code\nand gained several\ncredibility hallmarks\n, we aim to join the\nJournalism Trust Initiative\nin 2025, as part of our commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness. We will also enrol with\nReporters Shield\nto insure us against any frivolous legal suits.\nThere will also be challenges ahead, as we mark 10 years of HKFP this June. With a HK$1.7m deficit predicted for 2024, we will need to reduce costs and increase our income. We will therefore launch half a dozen new benefits for our valued\nHKFP Patrons\n, in order to safeguard our team and output.\nDespite the bumpy ride, HKFP still has breathing room to report freely on any local, hard news story. We remain\ndedicated to Hong Kong\n, as we are still able to speak to sources on the ground and exercise privileges lost in mainland China: bearing witness in court and at the legislature, and asking tough, direct questions of officials.\nI am happy to present our Annual Report, as we round-up our best coverage, achievements, and accounts from the past 12 months \u2013 all made possible by our monthly donors. The price of a weekly coffee will help us\nkeep the lights on and return to sustainability over the coming year\n. And for those of you who are already HKFP Patrons, thank you for your kind support, and for helping keep independent media alive in Hong Kong.\nAnnual Report 2024:\nOur Mission & Impact\n.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024\n.\nHKFP Awards\n.\nEthics at HKFP\n.\nImpact & Positioning\n.\nStaff & Structure\n.\nTransparency Report 2024\n.\nPress Freedom in 2024\n.\nReader Survey\n.\nHow to Support HKFP\n.\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload the 2024 Annual Report [PDF]\nMission and impact:\nFounded in 2015, Hong Kong Free Press is an impartial, non-profit, award-winning English-language newspaper. Run by journalists, backed by readers and completely independent, HKFP is governed by a public code of ethics.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024:\nOriginal reporting\n: Hong Kong Free Press began 2024 not in its home city, but in Taipei, as voters headed to the polls to elect Taiwan\u2019s next leader. We spoke to\nyoung voters about their concerns\n, and Hongkongers who had moved there in the wake of the 2019 protests and were\ncasting their ballots for the first time\n.\nAhead of Lai-Ching-te\u2019s presidential inauguration, we sat down with Taiwan\u2019s outgoing foreign minister Joseph Wu, pro-Beijing figures, and academics to\ndiscuss the democratic island\u2019s uncertain future\n, and later\nlooked back at the Sunflower Movement\n10 years after students stormed the legislature to protest economic rapprochement with China.\nMost of our reporting, however, remained focused on issues that impacted Hongkongers. Mental health remained a major concern, as we explored the ways that mental health professionals and educators were seeking to\nstem an alarming rise in student suicides\n. When a man suffering from schizophrenia was shot dead by police at his home, his\nfamily told HKFP they could not understand why officers had been so quick to resort to firearms\n.\nIn an effort to gauge public opinion about major political developments \u2013 such as\nthe legislation of a new security law\n,\nDonald Trump\u2019s re-election as US president\n, and the\nopening of an exhibition dedicated to national security\n\u2013 we hit the streets to ask Hongkongers for their opinions.\nWe also spoke to social workers \u2013 whose field was the subject of a major government overhaul \u2013 about the lack of resistance to, or even discussion about, the changes within the sector. The\nsilence was a sign of the times in today\u2019s Hong Kong\n, they said, but uncharacteristic of the historically outspoken industry....",

      "content": "Hong Kong Free Press is proud to have gained the\nTrust Project\nhallmark \u2013 the first global transparency standard that proves a news outlet\u2019s commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness.\nThroughout this year, HKFP has been\npublicly disclosing and expanding its ethical policies, standards, reporting and corrections guidelines\nto adhere to the\neight Trust Indicators\n. The move seeks to improve media literacy and battle \u201cfake news,\u201d misinformation and\u00a0online propaganda.\nFirst adopted in March 2020,\nour newly-revamped guidelines\nlay out HKFP\u2019s mission, our priorities, our expectations for staff conduct and impartiality, as well as how we deal with issues such as AI, advertising, anonymity, balance, security, sourcing and issues of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and identity.\nWe now join around 300 newsrooms across the world displaying the Trust Mark symbol, including the BBC, Washington Post, Sky News, CTV and the Economist.\nWhat is the Trust Project? Click to view.\nThe Trust Project\nis an international consortium of news organisations building standards of transparency and working with technology platforms to affirm and amplify journalism\u2019s commitment to transparency, accuracy, inclusion and fairness so that the public can make informed news choices. It was founded and is led by award-winning journalist\nSally Lehrman.\nWhat are the 8 Trust Indicators?\n1. Best Practices \u2013 who is behind the news?\nIf a journalist\u2019s organization has rules they must follow to make sure their reporting is independent, accurate and honest, then their news will be more trustworthy.\nDoes the site use guidelines to protect honest and independent reporting?\nWhat is the site\u2019s mission and priorities?\nWho funds them?\n2. Journalist Expertise \u2013 who made this?\nWe are rarely there to see events in the news for ourselves, so we rely on the journalist. They should follow strict standards for gathering solid evidence and multiple perspectives.\nAre the journalist(s) credentials easily available?\nDo they have a good professional reputation as a journalist?\nAre they reporting on a topic or community they know well?\n3. Labels \u2013 news, opinion, or what?\nIt\u2019s important to know whether your news is impartial or deliberately biased. Stories should be clearly labelled if they are designed to persuade us to agree. If it\u2019s journalism, then it\u2019s meant to help us develop our\nown\nopinions.\nIs the story impartial or does it have a clear opinion?\nIs it highly partisan, sponsored or advertising something?\nIs the purpose clearly shown?\n4. References \u2013 what are the sources?\nWhen a journalist is developing a news story, they may use information from eye witnesses, documents and other places \u2013 called\nsources\n. When a journalist shows their sources, we can check their reliability for ourselves.\nFor investigative, in-depth or controversial stories, does the journalist provide sources for each claim?\nDo they give details so we can check the sources ourselves?\nDo other sources back up what is being said?\n5. Methods \u2013 why was it built?\nIf we know why a journalist chose a particular story and how they reported it, it\u2019s easier to interpret it. A journalist\u2019s methods help us know how fast-moving, well-researched or impartial the story may be.\nHow much reporting was done?\nWhat methods were used?\nWho else was involved in the process?\n6. Locally sourced \u2013 do they know you and your community?\nIf a journalist knows and lives in the community, they can explain an event or issue more sensitively and accurately. If not, they can improve their reporting by going there and speaking to others who have local and community knowledge.\nWas the reporting done with deep knowledge about the local situation or community?\nWas the journalist on the scene?\nDid the journalist make an effort to listen to members of the community?\n7. Diverse voices \u2013 who is in the news, who is missing?\nIf certain voices or experiences are missing from the news, we don\u2019t get the full picture. Look for voices less commonly heard in society, often because of race, class, generation, gender, sexual orientation, ideology or the region they live in.\nDoes the newsroom commit to bringing in diverse perspectives?\nIs there evidence that the journalist pays attention to diversity?\nAre some communities included only in stereotypical ways, or completely missing?\n8. Actionable feedback \u2013 does this news site listen to me?\nBy inviting and listening to public feedback, journalists can make sure their work is accurate and complete. The public also might help them find important news they had overlooked.\nDoes the news site invite the public to participate?\nDo they ask for feedback?\nDo they correct errors quickly, clearly and prominently?\nHKFP Policies, Ethics Code & Best Practices:\nClick to view our newly-revamped and expanded guidelines:\nAnnual Report\n.\nAwards\n.\nCommunity Guidelines\n.\nFreelance Charter\n.\nFunding\n.\nGuiding Principles\n.\nPlatforms\n.\nSecurity Law\n.\nStaff Roster\n.\nTransparency Report\n....",

(Readers donated crypto between 2021-2022. It was declared to Inland Revenue, and retained as an investment, hence it does not appear as 2004 \u201cincome\u201d above. HKFP supports Hong Kong\u2019s moves to become a crypto hub and hopes to accept Bitcoin again soon.)\n\ud83d\udd12 Future security:\nAs of 2021, HKFP has retained a HK$1.5m legal defence fund in light of new challenges to press freedom, in addition to an emergency fund of HK$1m. As HKFP will be joining the\nReporters Shield\nprogramme in 2025 \u2013 which will provide some monetary protection against frivolous lawsuits \u2013 the company\u2019s legal fund will be reduced to HK$1m.\n\ud83d\udca1Efficiency:\nHKFP is run as efficiently and prudently as possible, in order to maximise the impact of our donors\u2019 generosity.

      "content": "2020 has been a traumatic and confusing year for the best of us, but the lasting impact of\nthe Covid-19 pandemic\non children is easily overlooked. As part of our public service mission, HKFP commissioned a bilingual, copyright-friendly children\u2019s book to help youngsters in Hong Kong \u2013 and beyond \u2013 understand what is happening.\nBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\nwas illustrated by\nKitty N. Wong\n, written by Kitty and Daniel Levia, and includes a foreword by\nFull Cup Therapy\u2019s\nRachel Winston.\nDownload the book:\nLetter to parents \u2013\nclick to view\nWhen going through difficult times, parents often wonder and worry, \u201cWhat will be the impact of this on my child? How can I stop them from being traumatised?\u201d\nKitty N. Wong sought to produce a simple child friendly book to help reduce the traumatic impact of the recent pandemic upon children. Together with the experienced teacher and author Daniel Levia, we set out to make this happen.\nWhile the personal impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will vary, there is a common thread we are all experiencing; uncertainty. When we feel uncertain for prolonged periods of time it can set off feelings of fear and helplessness. It is hard for us to stay grounded but if we are lucky we may have learnt our own strategies for coping from the past that we can now draw upon. With limited life experience, and brains that are still developing, children depend upon us (their network of safe people) to lean upon. You are your child\u2019s most important resource!\nTwo very useful strategies for building your child\u2019s resilience are storytelling and fostering personal connection. Stories help children to make sense of their experiences and help them to recognise their own feelings, as well as the feelings of others. Feeling connected to our significant others is so important for regulating big emotions and having space to problem solve challenges in our daily lives. Snuggling up with your child to read this book ticks both of these resilience building boxes!\n\u201cBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\u201d is a heartfelt, hopeful and empowering story set in Asia. Bobby\u2019s story aims to help your child make sense of the pandemic and of the many feelings that may have come up as a result.\nBobby goes on an educational journey with Owl, releases his feelings and comes into a more empowered position. With the use of the reminder phrase PASS (Paws, Arms, Snouts & Spirits) helping your child to feel more empowered too.\nLastly, Owl holds a hopeful picture of the future while acknowledging the current challenges and difficult emotions. May we all try to embody this wise owl and hold the space for our children\u2019s emotions (however imperfectly). Of course this is not always possible and we too as adults need to seek out our own support systems at those times.\nBobby\u2019s story is an inspirational tale of how he was able to turn around his feelings of despair into hope. Through connection and with support he innovates new ways to play with and feel closer to his friends.\nWe hope that this book provides an opportunity for emotional connection for your child, as well as acting as a springboard for you as parents to have meaningful and productive conversations about this health crisis.\nRachel Winston\nRegistered Play & Creative Arts Therapist in Hong Kong\nfullcupplaytherapy.com\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English [PDF]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese [PDF]\nDownload\nDownload accompanying worksheets:\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Chinese worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nAdapt & translate:\nThe digital book is shared under a\nCC-BY-NC-SA: Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike (2020)\nCreative Commons license\n\u2013 it lets others remix, adapt, translate and build upon the book non-commercially, as long as new creations include full credits and the identical licence.\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nIf you have translated \u201cBobby\u201d into another language,\nplease get in touch\n, so we can share you work!\nVideo:\nTeam:\nKitty N.

      "content": "Dear readers and supporters,\nIdeas that HKFP could avoid some of the pressures faced by the rest of Hong Kong\u2019s independent media sector were dashed in 2024. Threats and harassment, official scrutiny from multiple government departments, pressure on our corporate partners, and false complaints to the authorities marked a bumpy year for our newsroom. We nevertheless battled our way through unscathed, reporting all cases of intimidation to the police and emerging with a strengthened determination to continue our work.\nFor the rest of Hong Kong, 2024 was equally eventful. It saw the passage of a\nnew security law\n, a\nprotest song banned\nand the departure of five\nforeign judges\nfrom the top court, whilst editors from the now-defunct Stand News were\njailed for sedition\n. Meanwhile, 45 democrats were\njailed over a democratic primary\n, the\nJournalist Association chair\nwas fired from the Wall Street Journal, Apple Daily founder\nJimmy Lai took the stand\nin court, and the city recorded the\nhottest year on record\n.\nOur team reported on every beat, with a bumper year for award nominations. HKFP was shortlisted for an International Press Institute\nFree Media Pioneer\naward and a Reporters Without Border\nPress Freedom Prize\n. We also won a\nprize for photography\n, for\ncourage and impact\n, and we were nominated for a prestigious\nSOPA in regional reporting\n.\nHaving previously bolstered our\nEthics Code\nand gained several\ncredibility hallmarks\n, we aim to join the\nJournalism Trust Initiative\nin 2025, as part of our commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness. We will also enrol with\nReporters Shield\nto insure us against any frivolous legal suits.\nThere will also be challenges ahead, as we mark 10 years of HKFP this June. With a HK$1.7m deficit predicted for 2024, we will need to reduce costs and increase our income. We will therefore launch half a dozen new benefits for our valued\nHKFP Patrons\n, in order to safeguard our team and output.\nDespite the bumpy ride, HKFP still has breathing room to report freely on any local, hard news story. We remain\ndedicated to Hong Kong\n, as we are still able to speak to sources on the ground and exercise privileges lost in mainland China: bearing witness in court and at the legislature, and asking tough, direct questions of officials.\nI am happy to present our Annual Report, as we round-up our best coverage, achievements, and accounts from the past 12 months \u2013 all made possible by our monthly donors. The price of a weekly coffee will help us\nkeep the lights on and return to sustainability over the coming year\n. And for those of you who are already HKFP Patrons, thank you for your kind support, and for helping keep independent media alive in Hong Kong.\nAnnual Report 2024:\nOur Mission & Impact\n.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024\n.\nHKFP Awards\n.\nEthics at HKFP\n.\nImpact & Positioning\n.\nStaff & Structure\n.\nTransparency Report 2024\n.\nPress Freedom in 2024\n.\nReader Survey\n.\nHow to Support HKFP\n.\nHKFP Annual Report 2024\nDownload the 2024 Annual Report [PDF]\nMission and impact:\nFounded in 2015, Hong Kong Free Press is an impartial, non-profit, award-winning English-language newspaper. Run by journalists, backed by readers and completely independent, HKFP is governed by a public code of ethics.\nThe Best of HKFP 2024:\nOriginal reporting\n: Hong Kong Free Press began 2024 not in its home city, but in Taipei, as voters headed to the polls to elect Taiwan\u2019s next leader. We spoke to\nyoung voters about their concerns\n, and Hongkongers who had moved there in the wake of the 2019 protests and were\ncasting their ballots for the first time\n.\nAhead of Lai-Ching-te\u2019s presidential inauguration, we sat down with Taiwan\u2019s outgoing foreign minister Joseph Wu, pro-Beijing figures, and academics to\ndiscuss the democratic island\u2019s uncertain future\n, and later\nlooked back at the Sunflower Movement\n10 years after students stormed the legislature to protest economic rapprochement with China.\nMost of our reporting, however, remained focused on issues that impacted Hongkongers. Mental health remained a major concern, as we explored the ways that mental health professionals and educators were seeking to\nstem an alarming rise in student suicides\n. When a man suffering from schizophrenia was shot dead by police at his home, his\nfamily told HKFP they could not understand why officers had been so quick to resort to firearms\n.\nIn an effort to gauge public opinion about major political developments \u2013 such as\nthe legislation of a new security law\n,\nDonald Trump\u2019s re-election as US president\n, and the\nopening of an exhibition dedicated to national security\n\u2013 we hit the streets to ask Hongkongers for their opinions.\nWe also spoke to social workers \u2013 whose field was the subject of a major government overhaul \u2013 about the lack of resistance to, or even discussion about, the changes within the sector. The\nsilence was a sign of the times in today\u2019s Hong Kong\n, they said, but uncharacteristic of the historically outspoken industry....",

The move seeks to improve media literacy and battle \u201cfake news,\u201d misinformation and\u00a0online propaganda.\nFirst adopted in March 2020,\nour newly-revamped guidelines\nlay out HKFP\u2019s mission, our priorities, our expectations for staff conduct and impartiality, as well as how we deal with issues such as AI, advertising, anonymity, balance, security, sourcing and issues of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and identity.\nWe now join around 300 newsrooms across the world displaying the Trust Mark symbol, including the BBC, Washington Post, Sky News, CTV and the Economist.\nWhat is the Trust Project? Click to view.\nThe Trust Project\nis an international consortium of news organisations building standards of transparency and working with technology platforms to affirm and amplify journalism\u2019s commitment to transparency, accuracy, inclusion and fairness so that the public can make informed news choices. It was founded and is led by award-winning journalist\nSally Lehrman.\nWhat are the 8 Trust Indicators?\n1. Best Practices \u2013 who is behind the news?\nIf a journalist\u2019s organization has rules they must follow to make sure their reporting is independent, accurate and honest, then their news will be more trustworthy.\nDoes the site use guidelines to protect honest and independent reporting?\nWhat is the site\u2019s mission and priorities?\nWho funds them?\n2. Journalist Expertise \u2013 who made this?\nWe are rarely there to see events in the news for ourselves, so we rely on the journalist. They should follow strict standards for gathering solid evidence and multiple perspectives.\nAre the journalist(s) credentials easily available?\nDo they have a good professional reputation as a journalist?\nAre they reporting on a topic or community they know well?\n3. Labels \u2013 news, opinion, or what?\nIt\u2019s important to know whether your news is impartial or deliberately biased. Stories should be clearly labelled if they are designed to persuade us to agree. If it\u2019s journalism, then it\u2019s meant to help us develop our\nown\nopinions.\nIs the story impartial or does it have a clear opinion?\nIs it highly partisan, sponsored or advertising something?\nIs the purpose clearly shown?\n4. References \u2013 what are the sources?\nWhen a journalist is developing a news story, they may use information from eye witnesses, documents and other places \u2013 called\nsources\n. When a journalist shows their sources, we can check their reliability for ourselves.\nFor investigative, in-depth or controversial stories, does the journalist provide sources for each claim?\nDo they give details so we can check the sources ourselves?\nDo other sources back up what is being said?\n5. Methods \u2013 why was it built?\nIf we know why a journalist chose a particular story and how they reported it, it\u2019s easier to interpret it. A journalist\u2019s methods help us know how fast-moving, well-researched or impartial the story may be.\nHow much reporting was done?\nWhat methods were used?\nWho else was involved in the process?\n6. Locally sourced \u2013 do they know you and your community?\nIf a journalist knows and lives in the community, they can explain an event or issue more sensitively and accurately. If not, they can improve their reporting by going there and speaking to others who have local and community knowledge.\nWas the reporting done with deep knowledge about the local situation or community?\nWas the journalist on the scene?\nDid the journalist make an effort to listen to members of the community?\n7. Diverse voices \u2013 who is in the news, who is missing?\nIf certain voices or experiences are missing from the news, we don\u2019t get the full picture. Look for voices less commonly heard in society, often because of race, class, generation, gender, sexual orientation, ideology or the region they live in.\nDoes the newsroom commit to bringing in diverse perspectives?\nIs there evidence that the journalist pays attention to diversity?\nAre some communities included only in stereotypical ways, or completely missing?\n8. Actionable feedback \u2013 does this news site listen to me?\nBy inviting and listening to public feedback, journalists can make sure their work is accurate and complete. The public also might help them find important news they had overlooked.\nDoes the news site invite the public to participate?\nDo they ask for feedback?\nDo they correct errors quickly, clearly and prominently?\nHKFP Policies, Ethics Code & Best Practices:\nClick to view our newly-revamped and expanded guidelines:\nAnnual Report\n.\nAwards\n.\nCommunity Guidelines\n.\nFreelance Charter\n.\nFunding\n.\nGuiding Principles\n.\nPlatforms\n.\nSecurity Law\n.\nStaff Roster\n.\nTransparency Report\n....",

      "content": "2020 has been a traumatic and confusing year for the best of us, but the lasting impact of\nthe Covid-19 pandemic\non children is easily overlooked. As part of our public service mission, HKFP commissioned a bilingual, copyright-friendly children\u2019s book to help youngsters in Hong Kong \u2013 and beyond \u2013 understand what is happening.\nBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\nwas illustrated by\nKitty N. Wong\n, written by Kitty and Daniel Levia, and includes a foreword by\nFull Cup Therapy\u2019s\nRachel Winston.\nDownload the book:\nLetter to parents \u2013\nclick to view\nWhen going through difficult times, parents often wonder and worry, \u201cWhat will be the impact of this on my child? How can I stop them from being traumatised?\u201d\nKitty N. Wong sought to produce a simple child friendly book to help reduce the traumatic impact of the recent pandemic upon children. Together with the experienced teacher and author Daniel Levia, we set out to make this happen.\nWhile the personal impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will vary, there is a common thread we are all experiencing; uncertainty. When we feel uncertain for prolonged periods of time it can set off feelings of fear and helplessness. It is hard for us to stay grounded but if we are lucky we may have learnt our own strategies for coping from the past that we can now draw upon. With limited life experience, and brains that are still developing, children depend upon us (their network of safe people) to lean upon. You are your child\u2019s most important resource!\nTwo very useful strategies for building your child\u2019s resilience are storytelling and fostering personal connection. Stories help children to make sense of their experiences and help them to recognise their own feelings, as well as the feelings of others. Feeling connected to our significant others is so important for regulating big emotions and having space to problem solve challenges in our daily lives. Snuggling up with your child to read this book ticks both of these resilience building boxes!\n\u201cBobby Baboon and the Invisible Buggies\u201d is a heartfelt, hopeful and empowering story set in Asia. Bobby\u2019s story aims to help your child make sense of the pandemic and of the many feelings that may have come up as a result.\nBobby goes on an educational journey with Owl, releases his feelings and comes into a more empowered position. With the use of the reminder phrase PASS (Paws, Arms, Snouts & Spirits) helping your child to feel more empowered too.\nLastly, Owl holds a hopeful picture of the future while acknowledging the current challenges and difficult emotions. May we all try to embody this wise owl and hold the space for our children\u2019s emotions (however imperfectly). Of course this is not always possible and we too as adults need to seek out our own support systems at those times.\nBobby\u2019s story is an inspirational tale of how he was able to turn around his feelings of despair into hope. Through connection and with support he innovates new ways to play with and feel closer to his friends.\nWe hope that this book provides an opportunity for emotional connection for your child, as well as acting as a springboard for you as parents to have meaningful and productive conversations about this health crisis.\nRachel Winston\nRegistered Play & Creative Arts Therapist in Hong Kong\nfullcupplaytherapy.com\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English [PDF]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese [PDF]\nDownload\nDownload accompanying worksheets:\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Chinese worksheet [DOC]\nDownload\nAdapt & translate:\nThe digital book is shared under a\nCC-BY-NC-SA: Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike (2020)\nCreative Commons license\n\u2013 it lets others remix, adapt, translate and build upon the book non-commercially, as long as new creations include full credits and the identical licence.\nBobby Baboon \u2013 English, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nBobby Baboon \u2013 Traditional Chinese, adaptable [Powerpoint]\nDownload\nIf you have translated \u201cBobby\u201d into another language,\nplease get in touch\n, so we can share you work!\nVideo:\nTeam:\nKitty N.

      "content": "Hong Kong Free Press is proud to have gained the\nTrust Project\nhallmark \u2013 the first global transparency standard that proves a news outlet\u2019s commitment to original reporting, accuracy, inclusion, and fairness.\nThroughout this year, HKFP has been\npublicly disclosing and expanding its ethical policies, standards, reporting and corrections guidelines\nto adhere to the\neight Trust Indicators\n. The move seeks to improve media literacy and battle \u201cfake news,\u201d misinformation and\u00a0online propaganda.\nFirst adopted in March 2020,\nour newly-revamped guidelines\nlay out HKFP\u2019s mission, our priorities, our expectations for staff conduct and impartiality, as well as how we deal with issues such as AI, advertising, anonymity, balance, security, sourcing and issues of race, religion, sexual orientation, disability and identity.\nWe now join around 300 newsrooms across the world displaying the Trust Mark symbol, including the BBC, Washington Post, Sky News, CTV and the Economist.\nWhat is the Trust Project? Click to view.\nThe Trust Project\nis an international consortium of news organisations building standards of transparency and working with technology platforms to affirm and amplify journalism\u2019s commitment to transparency, accuracy, inclusion and fairness so that the public can make informed news choices. It was founded and is led by award-winning journalist\nSally Lehrman.\nWhat are the 8 Trust Indicators?\n1. Best Practices \u2013 who is behind the news?\nIf a journalist\u2019s organization has rules they must follow to make sure their reporting is independent, accurate and honest, then their news will be more trustworthy.\nDoes the site use guidelines to protect honest and independent reporting?\nWhat is the site\u2019s mission and priorities?\nWho funds them?\n2. Journalist Expertise \u2013 who made this?\nWe are rarely there to see events in the news for ourselves, so we rely on the journalist. They should follow strict standards for gathering solid evidence and multiple perspectives.\nAre the journalist(s) credentials easily available?\nDo they have a good professional reputation as a journalist?\nAre they reporting on a topic or community they know well?\n3. Labels \u2013 news, opinion, or what?\nIt\u2019s important to know whether your news is impartial or deliberately biased. Stories should be clearly labelled if they are designed to persuade us to agree. If it\u2019s journalism, then it\u2019s meant to help us develop our\nown\nopinions.\nIs the story impartial or does it have a clear opinion?\nIs it highly partisan, sponsored or advertising something?\nIs the purpose clearly shown?\n4. References \u2013 what are the sources?\nWhen a journalist is developing a news story, they may use information from eye witnesses, documents and other places \u2013 called\nsources\n. When a journalist shows their sources, we can check their reliability for ourselves.\nFor investigative, in-depth or controversial stories, does the journalist provide sources for each claim?\nDo they give details so we can check the sources ourselves?\nDo other sources back up what is being said?\n5. Methods \u2013 why was it built?\nIf we know why a journalist chose a particular story and how they reported it, it\u2019s easier to interpret it. A journalist\u2019s methods help us know how fast-moving, well-researched or impartial the story may be.\nHow much reporting was done?\nWhat methods were used?\nWho else was involved in the process?\n6. Locally sourced \u2013 do they know you and your community?\nIf a journalist knows and lives in the community, they can explain an event or issue more sensitively and accurately. If not, they can improve their reporting by going there and speaking to others who have local and community knowledge.\nWas the reporting done with deep knowledge about the local situation or community?\nWas the journalist on the scene?\nDid the journalist make an effort to listen to members of the community?\n7. Diverse voices \u2013 who is in the news, who is missing?\nIf certain voices or experiences are missing from the news, we don\u2019t get the full picture. Look for voices less commonly heard in society, often because of race, class, generation, gender, sexual orientation, ideology or the region they live in.\nDoes the newsroom commit to bringing in diverse perspectives?\nIs there evidence that the journalist pays attention to diversity?\nAre some communities included only in stereotypical ways, or completely missing?\n8. Actionable feedback \u2013 does this news site listen to me?\nBy inviting and listening to public feedback, journalists can make sure their work is accurate and complete. The public also might help them find important news they had overlooked.\nDoes the news site invite the public to participate?\nDo they ask for feedback?\nDo they correct errors quickly, clearly and prominently?\nHKFP Policies, Ethics Code & Best Practices:\nClick to view our newly-revamped and expanded guidelines:\nAnnual Report\n.\nAwards\n.\nCommunity Guidelines\n.\nFreelance Charter\n.\nFunding\n.\nGuiding Principles\n.\nPlatforms\n.\nSecurity Law\n.\nStaff Roster\n.\nTransparency Report\n....",
