Contact the NPR sponsorship team at National Public Media to learn more about opportunities for your brand.
For more than 45 years, NPR has been working to "create a more informed public." Today, that means making its fact-based journalism and storytelling accessible everywhere people are - from radio to digital and podcasts, and now across events, voice activation and IOT.
An innovative corporate sponsorship program helps sustain this work and fuel the future of NPR. Through collaboration with National Public Media, NPR sponsorship opportunities now extend across a growing number of platforms including smart speakers and award-winning integrations in the NPR.org audio player. On every platform, sponsorship is designed to prioritize user experience, offer transparency and fit the aesthetic of the NPR environment.
National Public Media is the exclusive sponsorship sales team for NPR and delivers sponsorship revenue to stations across the country. Committed to supporting the continued growth of public media, it works to ensure sponsorship is valuable to brands and audiences alike, and to advance universal best practices in audience research, measurement, product design, brand creative and more.
For additional information on NPR sponsorship opportunities and insights on audio advertising, visit

To connect with National Public Media staff about a speaking opportunity or interview request, email Devon Landis at dlandis (at) nationalpublicmedia (dot) com.
All NPR funding sources, including corporate sponsors, are considered under the "access" principle, which means that NPR has no list of sources from which funding will not be accepted. However, potential conflict of interest and problems of listener misperception, confusion, or similar reason regarding the funder's role and/or influence on programming will be considered in accepting or rejecting underwriting.

Russia Intensifies Attacks On Ukraine, Summer Travel Season, Wildfire Forecast
May 26, 2025 •
Ukrainian officials say Russia launched its largest airstrikes since the start of the conflict. Sunday's attack, which killed 12 people, happened only hours before a prisoner exchange. Memorial Day is considered the unofficial start of summer and the summer travel season, but a deadly midair collision in the nation's capital in January and reports of air traffic control outages have raised safety concerns. Also, government forecasts predict an above normal wildfire risk for some parts of the country yet cuts to the US Forest Service makes fighting fires harder.

While NPR shares a mission with our Member organizations, we are funded in significantly different but interrelated ways.
NPR Revenues
NPR is an independent, non-profit media organization. We are also a membership organization of separately licensed and operated public radio stations across the United States. Station membership in NPR is a local public radio station editorial and business decision.
NPR's two largest revenue sources are corporate sponsorships and fees paid by NPR Member organizations to support a suite of programs, tools, and services. Other sources of revenue include institutional grants, individual contributions and fees paid by users of the Public Radio Satellite System (public radio station interconnection and distribution).
Breakdown of NPR's Revenue
Fees from NPR Member organizations
Organizations that choose to be NPR Members pay two types of fees to NPR, 100% of which support the Member benefits that NPR provides:
A core fee that includes the NPR newsmagazines (Morning Edition, All Things Considered, Weekend Edition) for news format stations, an array of digital content, tools and platforms, and a suite of services designed to drive audience engagement and support.
License fees for an optional portfolio of individual broadcast programs offering current affairs, entertainment, and cultural topics.
The core fee calculation is based on a percentage of stations' local membership revenue, as a reflection of the value that NPR programs and services provide to Members and their communities.
The license fees for individual news/talk, entertainment, and music programs (e.g. programs like Fresh Air, Here & Now, 1A, World Cafe, or Throughline) are based on pricing tiers based on each Member's total revenue.
The fee model includes provisions that recognize Members with particular characteristics that contribute to NPR's audience service mission, including Members designated by CPB as serving rural and minority audiences.

NPR's mission is to work in partnership with Member stations to create a more informed public – one challenged and invigorated by a deeper understanding and appreciation of events, ideas and cultures. To ensure that our content is accessible to
all
audiences, we have implemented practices and procedures to aid in the accessibility of our content and distribution platforms.
NPR currently supports the accessibility of our content with:
Transcripts
Screen reader compatibility
Video captioning
Keyboard navigation
Skip links
Aria labels
Color contrast ratio testing
Below are details about some of these efforts, and information about how we work with third parties.
Transcripts
NPR aspires to make transcripts available for all NPR-produced broadcast shows and podcasts. We publish transcripts as soon as they are available. Because transcripts are generated based on published audio and then reviewed for accuracy, they will not be immediately available at the same time as the story audio.
The transcript button appears on the audio player bar for story pages and podcast episode pages at
NPR.org
.
Transcripts are typically published or linked directly on individual story pages at
NPR.org
. Alternatively, you can access the
NPR.org Transcripts page
to scan a list of transcripts and filter by publication date. NPR transcripts from as early as 1990 are free in many public libraries.
Please note that NPR platforms and products also include some programming produced by third parties and NPR cannot guarantee transcripts for that content. More detail is available in the section on third-party content below.
Please email
accessibility@npr.org
if you aren't able to find a specific transcript and need assistance.
Screen reader compatibility
NPR works to ensure that our websites and applications are screen reader compatible and guided by the standards recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). We recommend using the most recent versions of web browsers and mobile appl...
